The Pastaza Marañón Foreland Basin (PMFB), within the Peruvian Amazon, is known to store large amounts of peat, but the remoteness of the region makes field data collection and mapping the distribution of peatland ecotypes challenging. Here we review methods for developing high accuracy peatland maps for the PMFB using a combination of multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing in a machine learning classifier. The new map produced has 95% overall accuracy with low errors of commission (1–6%) and errors of omission (0–15%) for individual peatland classes. We attribute this improvement in map accuracy over previous maps of the region to the inclusion of high and low water season SAR images which provides information about seasonal hydrological dynamics. The new multi-date map showed an increase in area of more than 200% for pole forest peatland (6% error) compared to previous maps, which had high errors for that ecotype (20–36%). Likewise, estimates of C stocks were 35% greater than previously reported (3.238 Pg in Draper et al. (2014) to 4.360 Pg in our study). Most of the increase is attributed to pole forest peatland which contributed 58% (2.551 Pg) of total C, followed by palm swamp (34%, 1.476 Pg). In an assessment of deforestation from 2010 to 2018 in the PMFB, we found 89% of the deforestation was in seasonally flooded forest and 43% of deforestation was occurring within 1 km of a river or road. Peatlands were found the least affected by deforestation and there was not a noticeable trend over time. With development of improved transportation routes and population pressures, future land use change is likely to put South American tropical peatlands at risk, making continued monitoring a necessity. Accurate mapping of peatland ecotypes with high resolution (<30 m) sensors linked with field data are needed to reduce uncertainties in estimates of the distribution of C stocks, and to aid in deforestation monitoring. © Copyright © 2021 Bourgeau-Chavez, Grelik, Battaglia, Leisman, Chimner, Hribljan, Lilleskov, Draper, Zutta, Hergoualc’h, Bhomia and Lähteenoja.","Amazon; carbon; deforestation; L-band radar; PALSAR; peatland; tropical"

Therefore, fungi strains isolated for the first time from a tropical peat at Santo Amaro das Brotas (Brazil) were studied for fluoranthene biodegradation. Fusarium sp. AC-7, Penicillium sp. AC-1 and Penicillium sp. AC-6 were isolated using fluoranthene as sole carbon source. All strains were tested for biodegradation of 100 mg L-1 fluoranthene during 14 and 28 days. After 28 days of biodegradation, 64 ± 3, 60 ± 4 and 51 ± 2% biodegradation was observed for Penicillium sp. AC-1, Penicillium sp. AC-6 and Fusarium sp. AC-7, respectively. Analysis of the obtained compounds enabled the identification of four metabolites, which were common to the three employed strains: Anthrone, anthraquinone, 9-methoxyanthracene and cyclopropa[1]phenanthrene. It is important to note that control experiments were performed. The obtained results clearly demonstrated the efficiency of tropical peat fungi in the transformation of fluoranthene. These findings showed the potential of tropical peats for isolation of fungi and indicated that these strains can be applied for bioremediation processes of areas contaminated with fluoranthene and other PAHs. © 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

In the Serra do Espinhaço Meridional (south-eastern Brazil), numerous peatlands occur in the headwaters of several watercourses that feed rivers of uttermost importance. The present study aimed to characterise the water retention curves for two peatlands under forest and grassland vegetation. Four peat cores were collected, then sampled every 15 cm. Undisturbed samples were used for water retention analysis and disturbed samples for organic matter characterisation. Water retention data fitted well to bimodal sigmoid retention curves, indicating that the porous system is composed of at least two subsystems with different retention behaviours. One subsystem follows a smooth sigmoid trend at higher matric potentials, while the other subsystem accounts for the steep decrease in water content beyond matric potentials around-7,000 cm. The pore size distribution also reflected this bimodal behaviour, with two distinct peaks around 50 and 0.4 µm. Water retention was predominantly affected by bulk density, which reflected the differences in mineral and organic matter content. The degree of decomposition and lignocellulosic composition of the organic matter also significantly affected water retention, especially at lower matric potentials. © 2022, IMCG and IPS.

High-elevation wetlands, known locally as “bofedales”, are an understudied Andean ecosystem despite their key role in carbon sequestration, maintenance of biodiversity, and regulation of water flow. Here, we analyze subfossil diatom assemblages and other siliceous bioindicators preserved in a peat core collected from a bofedal in Peru’s Cordillera Vilcanota. Basal radiocarbon ages show the bofedal likely formed during a wet period of the Little Ice Age (1520–1680 CE), as inferred from nearby ice core data. The subfossil diatom record is marked by several dynamic assemblage shifts documenting a hydrosere succession from an open-water system to mature peatland. The diatoms appear to be responding largely to changes in hydrology that occur within the natural development of the bofedal, but also to pH and possibly nutrient enrichment from grazing animals. The rapid peat accretion recorded post-1950 at this site is consistent with recent peat growth rates elsewhere in the Andes. Given the many threats to Peruvian bofedales including climate change, overgrazing, peat extraction, and mining, these baseline data will be critical to assessing future change in these important ecosystems. © 2021, Canadian Science Publishing.

For 8 years (2015-2022), we measured carbon dioxide net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and evapotranspiration (ET) using eddy covariance towers in a temperate rainforest and a peatland in southern Chile. NEE was partitioned into gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco), while ET was partitioned into evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) and used to estimate different expressions of ecosystem WUE. We then used the correlation between detrended time series and structural equation modelling to identify the main environmental drivers of WUE, GPP, ET, E and T. The results showed that the forest was a consistent carbon sink (-486g23gCg m-2g yr-1), while the peatland was, on average, a small source (33g21gCg m-2g yr-1). WUE is low in both ecosystems and likely explained by the high annual precipitation in this region (g 1/4g 2100g mm). Only expressions of WUE that included atmospheric water demand showed seasonal variation. Variations in WUE were related more to changes in ET than to changes in GPP, while T remained relatively stable, accounting for around 47g % of ET for most of the study period. For both ecosystems, E increased with higher global radiation and higher surface conductance and when the water table was closer to the surface. Higher values for E were also found with increased wind speeds in the forest and higher air temperatures in the peatland. The absence of a close relationship between ET and GPP is likely related to the dominance of plant species that either do not have stomata (i.e. mosses in the peatland or epiphytes in the forest) or have poor stomatal control (i.e. anisohydric tree species in the forest). The observed increase in potential ET in the last 2 decades and the projected drought in this region suggests that WUE could increase in these ecosystems, particularly in the forest, where stomatal control may be more significant.  © 2024 Jorge F.

Amazon peatlands are expected to be large source of atmospheric methane (CH4) emissions, however little is understood about the rates of CH4 flux or the microorganisms that mediate it in these environments. Here we studied a mineral nutrient gradient across peatlands in the Pastaza-Marañón Basin, the largest tropical peatland in South America, to describe CH4 fluxes and environmental factors that regulate species assemblages of methanogenic and methanotrophic microorganisms. Peatlands were grouped as minerotrophic, mixed and ombrotrophic categories by their general water source leading to different mineral nutrient content (rich, mixed and poor) quantified by trace elements abundance. Microbial communities clustered dependent on nutrient content (ANOSIM p < 0.001). Higher CH4 flux was associated with minerotrophic communities compared to the other categories. The most dominant methanogens and methanotrophs were represented by Methanobacteriaceae, and Methylocystaceae, respectively. Weighted network analysis demonstrated tight clustering of most methanogen families with minerotrophic-associated microbial families. Populations of Methylocystaceae were present across all peatlands. Null model testing for species assemblage patterns and species rank distributions confirmed non-random aggregations of Methylococcacae methanotroph and methanogen families (p < 0.05). We conclude that in studied amazon peatlands increasing mineral nutrient content provides favorable habitats for Methanobacteriaceae, while Methylocystaceae populations seem to broadly distribute independent of nutrient content. © Copyright © 2020 Finn, Ziv-El, van Haren, Park, del Aguila-Pasquel, Urquiza–Muñoz and Cadillo-Quiroz.","amazon; community assemblage; greenhouse gases; methane; methanogens; methanotrophs; peatlands"

Throughout the last decades, many causes are composed to explain the erosive process in these sectors, major associated with natural phenomena. These outcrops are considered as key elements in the understanding of the long term evolution of this coast. The chemical processing of the samples was made in cold mode with HCl (5%) and KOH (5%) and the separation of organic and inorganic particles with aqueous solution of ZnCl2.This study was based on peat samplings from geological surveys, outcrops and Georadar profiles in the beaches of Itapeva and Hermenegildo. The results of this study indicate that the basal layer covering the pleistocene sediments is formed by basal peat, chronologically signaling the beginning of Holocene sedimentation in the PCRGS around 10.000 years BP, when still essentially lacustrine conditions prevailed through the dominance of herbaceous and hydrophitic vegetation where the Holocene coastal barrier systems would develop. Once installed, these barriers created the conditions for the development of a second generation of paludal environments, this time linked to the reduction of the environmental depths during the process of filling since 710 years B.P. The results of the present study provide evidences that the current coastline of the Rio Grande do Sul is in a continuous process of reorientation, led by a sedimentary deficit in the coastal sectors where the retrograde barriers migrate towards the mainland and to the N-NO direction, exposing peat deposits systematically along the coast. © 2020, Universidade Estadual Paulista(UNESP).

Indonesia has 14 million hectares (ha) of oil palm; its palm oil exports were valued at USD 23 billion in 2017 and USD 21 billion in 2018. Both domestic and international communities, particularly the European Union (EU), have raised concerns about its sustainability and impact on forest conservation. For example, the European Parliament in 2017 issued a resolution to restrict the ability of EU countries to count palm oil-based biodiesel imports toward their renewable 2030 energy targets. This paper describes palm oil value chains in Indonesia at the national level, using value chain analysis and system dynamics modeling. The model is used to understand how the moratorium, peatland conservation, agrarian reform, and the EU biodiesel ban affect plantation expansion and production, employment, CO2 emissions, smallholder incomes, the private sector, and government. The model provides scenarios to make Indonesian palm oil more sustainable through intensification, no-deforestation, and no-peat strategies, as well as through land swapping. There are trade-offs between economic development and environmental conservation, but win-win solutions are available. Scenarios that build synergies between Indonesian palm oil development and forest conservation can help guide the new frontiers of oil palm development in Asia, South America, and Africa. © 2020 The Authors","Biodiesel; European Union; Palm oil; Smallholders; Sustainable development; Value chains"

Recent intensification and southwards migration of the SWW is projected to continue due to anthropogenic climate change and despite a recovering Antarctic ozone hole, impacting regional hydroclimate, ocean circulation and carbon cycling. Despite the importance of the SWW, our understanding of their behaviour on centennial to millennial timescales is limited by the inherently short observational record and limited palaeo-archive agreement on the wind belt's Holocene dynamics. Here we utilise dust flux, Itrax core scanning, rare earth element composition and HYSPLIT particle modelling to present a 8700-year (10,500–1700 cal yr BP) reconstruction of local SWW intensity from a Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) peat sediment core which, along with other reconstructions, we interpret in a regional South Atlantic and hemispheric context. We find increased dust deposition and variability from ca. 5700 cal yr BP, signalling an intensification and possible southwards shift of the SWW, though Patagonia likely remains the primary distal dust source throughout our record. Additionally, we identify asymmetric behaviour in the SWW belt from 3000 to 1700 cal yr BP over southern South America and the southwest Atlantic. In alignment with these findings, we propose a possible eastwards projection of the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) into the South Atlantic during this period. Two volcanic eruptions, likely from Mt Burney (ca. 9700 cal yr BP) and Mt Hudson (ca. 4100 cal yr BP), are captured as cryptotephra deposits in the record. Our precisely dated, high-resolution multiproxy record of South Atlantic wind-blown transport provides an important new dataset that accurately constrains SWW Holocene variability over the Falkland Islands. © 2023 The Authors","Amundsen Sea Low; Cryptotephra; Dust; Falkland Islands; HYSPLIT; Itrax; Peat; Radiocarbon dating; Rare earth elements; Southern hemisphere westerly winds"

In this study, we present a synthesis of published peat-core reconstructions and basal ages from high-elevation (>3000 m a.s.l.) sites in the northern and central Andes of South America. We complement this database by providing a new multi-proxy peat-core-based paleoecological reconstruction from the Alta Murmurani peatland, Cordillera Vilcanota, Peru. This record, with a peat inception age of 8980 cal. yr BP, was analyzed for plant macrofossils and stable isotopes (carbon, oxygen). This review (1) assesses the timing of peat initiation and development across the tropical high-elevation region of South America (8°N to 27°S); (2) assesses the reliability of peat-core paleoclimate reconstructions by comparing the peat-core inferences across sites and against other independent archives (e.g., lake sediments, ice cores, speleothems); and (3) determines which hydroclimatic conditions are favorable for peat formation and expansion across the study area. Our results show that peat initiation occurred throughout the Holocene, progressing from the northern Andes to central Andes, with highest initiation frequencies clustered at ca. 10,700 cal. yr BP and 8300 cal. yr BP, respectively. Our synthesis reveals that peat cores can be used to assess regional paleoclimate trends in the central Andes using a multi-proxy approach combining micro- and macrofossils such as pollen, stable isotopes, as well as organic and inorganic elemental analyses. We also identify three optimal peat-forming time periods, all with optimally wet conditions occurring at transitional hydroclimate phases: (1) following deglaciation, with warming temperatures and increased moisture related to glacial runoff (ca. 11,000 cal. yr BP and ∼8000 cal. yr BP), (2) under moderate moisture regimes related to intensifying ENSO and warmer conditions (∼3500 cal. yr BP), and (3) under conditions related to increased precipitation at the beginning of a cold period (Little Ice Age). We show that either regional climate (e.g., changes in precipitation) or local conditions (e.g., changes in glacial runoff) can promote peat formation across the study region. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Andes; Bofedales; Holocene; Paleoclimatology; Peatlands; South America; Stable isotopes; Vegetation dynamics"

The Bonn Challenge and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration underscore the international momentum of the restoration movement, with many countries committing to restore millions of hectares of deforested and degraded land in the next decade. Brazil and Indonesia are among the ones with the most ambitious restoration commitments globally. Since both their economies are highly dependent on the export of agricultural commodities, reconciling economic growth with environmental sustainability will be a major policy challenge. In this paper, we (a) identify the main restoration targets and the policies supporting their implementation in both countries, (b) provide a descriptive overview of these restoration-supportive policies, and (c) discuss the main challenges that Brazil and Indonesia face in the implementation of their restoration commitments. We find that Brazil has an explicit and dedicated strategy to achieve its restoration target, but that recent political developments have weakened environmental governance in the country, affecting the implementation of its restoration commitment.

The Serra do Espinhaço Meridional (SdEM), located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, can be considered one of the main areas of tropical mountain peatlands on Earth. When climate conditions are favorable, peatland formation occurs through the combination of lithology with relief and vegetation, whereby depressions favor the accumulation of water and nutrient poverty of quartzite lithologies induces the growth of vegetation rich in C metabolites and lignin. Anaerobiosis, together with organic matter resilience, low pH, and high Al3+ content, favor the successive accumulation of organic matter in time and space. The aim of this study is to correlate the age of basal organic matter of the SdEM peatlands with their altitudes and to identify the environmental factors that acted upon peatland formation. Eleven peatlands, situated between 1244 and 2014 m a.s.l., were identified using satellite imagery and cores were sampled in the field. Eighteen cores were collected from under grasslands and forest clusters in aluminum tubes of 8 cm in diameter. The basal layers, between 15 and 397 cm deep, had carbon content, average decomposition stage of organic matter, and radiocarbon age determined. Average carbon content increases and average decomposition stage of organic matter decreases with altitude. The peatlands situated below 1370 m a.s.l. would have begun to form in the Late Pleistocene, while those situated between 1580 and 1610 m a.s.l. would have begun to form in the Early and Middle Holocene, and those situated between 1760 and 2014 m a.s.l. would have begun their formation in the Late Holocene. In the southern hemisphere, the average temperatures would have been 9 °C lower than current average temperatures between 22 and 18 kyr BP. and, from 2 to 5 °C lower between 18 and 12 kyr BP. Between 12 and 8.8 kyr BP, the average temperatures varied from +2 to - 1 °C in relation to the current average temperatures. The favorable area for the establishment of vegetation cover in SdEM was smaller in the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) than in the warmer periods of the Holocene. The radiocarbon age of the basement layer of SdEM peatlands decreases with increased altitude. The colder climate of the Late Pleistocene limited the formation of peatlands above 1570 m a.s.l. in SdEM. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Holocene; Paleoclimatic changes; Peatland formation; Pleistocene; Vegetal cover"

Dust emissions in this region would therefore be expected to be sensitive to changes in these systems, in particular the strength and position of the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM). Here, we present a late-Holocene multi-proxy study where changes in dust flux, reconstructed from a high-altitude peat mire, are examined in light of climate variability and human impacts. Results show that for most the 4300 cal. yr BP record, dust flux sensitively tracked changes in SASM activity. Prior to 2600 cal. yr BP relatively high dust flux implies dry conditions prevailed across the Puna-Altiplao in association with reduced SASM activity. The chemistry of dust deposited at this time matched the large endorheic basins on the Puna, which host ephemeral lakes and terminal fans, indicating these were actively supplying dust to the airstream. After 2600 cal. yr BP, SASM activity increased while dust flux decreased and the dust chemistry changed, collectively implying the shutting down of the Puna-Altiplano as a significant dust source. Dust flux increased after 1000 cal. yr BP during the ‘Medieval Warm Period’, associated with a return to drier conditions and reactivation of dust sources across the endorheic basins of the Puna. Natural variability in dust flux was dwarfed, however, by the very significant increase in flux after 400 cal. yr BP following Spanish Colonisation and associated changing landuse practices. This finding attests to the globally significant role of humans on dust emissions. © The Author(s) 2020.","climate; dust; Holocene; landuse change; mire; peat; Puna-Altiplano; South America; South American summer monsoon"

These lipids form the basis of several frequently used paleoclimatic proxies. For example, the degree of methylation of brGDGTs (MBT’5Me) preserved in mineral soils (as well as peats and lakes) is one of the most important terrestrial paleothermometers, but features substantial variability that is so far insufficiently constrained. The distribution of isoGDGTs in mineral soils has received less attention and applications have focused on the use of the relative abundance of the isoGDGT crenarchaeol versus brGDGTs (BIT index) as an indicator of aridity. To expand our knowledge of the factors that can impact the br- and isoGDGT distribution in mineral soils, including the MBT’5Me index, and to improve isoGDGT-based precipitation reconstructions, we surveyed the GDGT distribution in a large collection of mineral surface soils (n = 229) and soil profiles (n = 22) across tropical South America. We find that the MBT’5Me index is significantly higher in grassland compared to forest soils, even among sites with the same mean annual air temperature. This is likely a result of a lack of shading in grasslands, leading to warmer soils. We also find a relationship between MBT’5Me and soil pH in tropical soils. Together with existing data from arid areas in mid-latitudes, we confirm the relationship between the BIT-index and aridity, but also find that the isoGDGT distribution alone is aridity dependent. The combined use of the BIT-index and isoGDGTs can strengthen reconstructions of past precipitation in terrestrial archives. In terms of site-specific variations, we find that the variability in BIT and MBT’5Me is larger at sites that show on average lower BIT and MBT’5Me values. In combination with modelling results, we suggest that this pattern arises from the mathematical formulation of these proxies that amplifies variability for intermediate values and mutes it for values close to saturation (value of 1). Soil profiles show relatively little variation with depth for the brGDGT indices. On the other hand, the isoGDGT distribution changes significantly with depth as does the relative abundance of br- versus isoGDGTs. This pattern is especially pronounced for the isoGDGTIsomerIndex where deeper soil horizons show a near absence of isoGDGT isomers. This might be driven by archaeal community changes in different soil horizons, potentially driven by the difference between aerobic and anaerobic archaeal communities. Finally, we use our extensive new dataset and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) to establish new brGDGT-based temperature models. We provide a tropical soil calibration that removes the pH dependence of tropical soils (n = 404; RMSE = 2.0 °C) and global peat and soil models calibrated against the temperature of the months above freezing (n = 1740; RMSE = 2.4) and mean annual air temperature (n = 1740; RMSE = 3.6). All models correct for the bias found in arid samples. We also successfully test the new calibrations on Chinese loess records and tropical river sediments. Overall, the new calibrations provide improved temperature reconstructions for terrestrial archives. © 2023 The Authors","GDGT; Machine learning; Precipitation; Temperature; Vegetation"

Using plants from 10 sites in 4 provinces, including pristine and industrial regions, and employing the metal-free, ultraclean SWAMP laboratory facilities and procedures, we provide an estimate of the natural abundance of trace elements in the leaves, and the extent of their release during hot water extraction. Elements decrease in abundance in the order Mn > Al > Fe > Zn > Cu > Ni > V > Pb > La > Mo > Y > La > Tl > Cd > Th > Ag. The greatest concentrations of conservative, lithophile elements such as Al, La, Th and Y, are found in samples collected on lands reclaimed from open pit bitumen mines in northern Alberta, reflecting elevated inputs of atmospheric dusts. In contrast, micronutrients such as Cu and Zn are remarkably uniform which suggests that these are supplied almost exclusively by plant uptake via roots. Deionized, reverse osmosis water is more effective in removing some elements (e.g. Al, La, Y, Fe, Zn, Cd) whereas others are more readily extracted using groundwater (e.g. Cu, Ni, Pb); V behaves independently of water composition. In both types of water, the elements most readily extracted are plant micronutrients (Mn, Ni, Cu, and Zn) whereas those supplied primarily by dust exhibit much lower yields; Al shows behaviour intermediate between these two extremes. While element concentrations in the infusions increase with increasing concentrations in the leaves, the abundance of potentially toxic chalcophile elements such as Cd, Pb, Sb and Tl in the infusions are extremely low (ng/l). Plants from British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec provide evidence of atmospheric Pb contamination, yielding greater ratios of Pb/La compared to the samples from Alberta where crustal values are found. Given that this plant is common and found across the northern half of the continent, it shows great promise as a tool for biomonitoring of air quality.

Importantly, the second edition examines how, over the last 10 years, research has both changed focus and where it is conducted. This shift essentially depicts ""a tale of two worlds""—one half (Western Europe, North America) moving away from coal and coalbed gas research and production towards cleaner energy resources, and the other half (Asia–Pacific region, Eastern Europe, South America) increasing both research and usage of coal. These changes are marked by a precipitous fall in coalbed gas production in North America; however, at the same time there has been a significant rise in coal and coalbed gas production in Australia, China, and India. The driver for higher production and its associated research is a quest for affordable energy and economic security that a large resource base brings to any country like Australia’s first large-scale coalbed gas to liquid natural gas projects supplying the demand for cleaner burning LNG to the Asian-Pacific region. Since the last edition of this book, global climate change policies have more forcibly emphasized the impact of methane from coal mines and placed these emissions equal to, or even more harmful than, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels in general. Governmental policies have prioritized capture, use, and storage of CO2, burning coal in new highly efficient low emission power plants, and gas pre-drainage of coal mines. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and China are also introducing new research into alternative, non-fuel uses for coal, such as carbon fibers, nanocarbons, graphene, soil amendments, and as an unconventional ore for critical elements. New to this edition: Each chapter is substantially changed from the 1st edition including expanded and new literature citations and reviews, important new data and information, new features and materials, as well as re-organized and re-designed themes. Importantly, three new chapters cover global coal endowment and gas potential, groundwater systems related to coalbed gas production and biogenic gas generation as well as the changing landscape of coal and coalbed gas influenced by global climate change and net-zero carbon greenhouse gas emissions. FOREWORD When I reviewed the first edition of this book, my initial thought was, ""Do we need another book on coal geology?"" and then I read it and realised, ""Yes, we need this book"" and my students downloaded copies as soon as it was available. So now we come to 2023, and a lot has happened in the past decade. For a different reason we might ask if we still need this book, or even coal geoscientists and engineers, as the world aims for rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector and a reduction of coal as a feedstock for industrial resources, like steel manufacture. Natural gas is earmarked as a transition fuel to enable the shift to renewables. In some basins, the source of that gas is directly from coalbed gas production or from conventional reservoirs that were charged by coal and terrestrial organic source rocks. Although the transition is escalating, there are projections that coal will remain part of our future, even after 2050, and can also provide alternative non-fuel resources (e.g., critical elements and carbon-based nanomaterials). Between now and then, we’d best ensure that we extract and utilise coal and coalbed gas as efficiently and safely as possible, that we mitigate any environmental and social impact of the process, and that we improve our certainty of predicting the behaviour of the material and material impacts. To do this we need to understand coal as a material and the inherent variability of its quality and behaviour as a source rock and host of coalbed gas. One can change the technologies but not the geological ground conditions or coal character of the targeted resource. The authors have taken on this ambitious endeavour during their careers and have attempted to capture their knowledge gained from first-hand experience in countries around the world and comprehensive review of published material, within this book. At least three generations of knowledge are drawn upon here. Tim Moore was a student of both Romeo Flores and his supervisor John Ferm, who was the ""Warrior of Gentleness"" when it came to coal research, teaching, and supervision. This book also reflects the broad and multidisciplinary aspects of coal geology and coal science and provides the tenets for one to understand different disciplines and how they interact to form an integrated view of the resource—technically, economically, and politically. Each chapter takes the reader through different concepts, first setting the scene by examining the status of coal and coalbed gas in a carbon-conscious world, then looking at the science behind coal as a source of gas and as a reservoir- in its own right. Further reading leads to learning about geological settings and the processes through time that led to present-day endowments around the globe and this theme continues throughout the book with detailed examples from different countries. Personally, I like the emphasis on the depositional environments that lead to peat accumulation and preservation—it’s all about the ingredients—which leads nicely into the world of coal macerals and minerals, and why they matter. Coalification and its role in changing the chemistry and material properties of coal is covered from a reservoir perspective, as is the role of biogenic processes. These have produced some of the enormous gas resources we exploit today and could also provide a future circular economy for neo-biogenic gas. The role of groundwater in this past and potentially future endeavour is presented, along with possible adverse effects where there is unexpected communication with regional and local aquifers and surface assets that detract from environmental and social licence. In addition to describing the geology and engineering technologies required to explore for, access, and utilise these resources, the book also provides insights into geostatistical and economic modelling for reserves estimation and challenges as reservoirs become more geologically and politically complex for extraction and alternatively, for injection and carbon sequestration. The final chapters revisit and integrate concepts presented in the book in order to examine global gas production and the geographic shifts in production and research that have occurred over the past decade(s). The also show how government and the market play a role, and project future trends. The authors provide discussion points for the outlook of coal as a fuel feedstock in a carbon-constrained world and the ongoing search for options and alternative non-fuel uses of coal while highlighting the important role that coal and coalbed gas still play during the transition period and beyond. There is much to learn from this book, which is based on decades of observing and interpreting patterns and trends in coal and coal-bearing basins. There is a growing trend towards using machine learning and artificial intelligence to find patterns in data and provide solutions. I’d suggest that domain intelligence, such as that provided in this book, is critical to supervising this process and is required for understanding and validating the outputs upon which many decisions are made and will continue to be made in the future. So yes, we need this book and I invite you to read, learn, and form your own ideas. If you find any gaps—write about them. Joan S.

Despite their importance, little is known about millennial scale changes in the SWW and how they have influenced the climate system in the past and interacted with the Earth's surface elements, such as dust, nutrients and carbon. Here we present a dust record from a 6.6 kyr old peat core in Amsterdam Island (AMS) situated at the northern edge of the SWW (37°S) in the Southern Indian Ocean. Mineral dust flux was used to track atmospheric dust production, long-distance transport and subsequent deposition. Dust provenance was determined from rare earth element (REE) and Nd isotopic signatures (εNd) in the peat core, compared with a reference dataset of Southern Hemisphere dust sources. Using a multi-proxy mixing model, the εNd and REE ratios show a relatively uniform mixture of ca. 40% local, 15% Southern African and 45% Southern South American dust sources since 6.6 cal kyr BP. However, from 1910 AD onwards, there is a doubling in the contribution from Southern Africa (32%). Two mineral dust flux minima occur at 6.2–4.9 cal kyr BP and 3.9–2.7 cal kyr BP, interpreted as periods with equatorward-shifted and/or strengthened SWW at the northern edge of the wind belt. Conversely, periods of higher dust flux at 6.6–6.2 cal kyr BP, 4.9–3.9 cal kyr BP, and 1.4 cal kyr BP onwards are interpreted as poleward-shifted and/or weakened SWW. These interpretations are based on the findings that higher (lower) wind speeds lead to enhanced (less) removal of distal dust on the way to AMS, by wet deposition and turbulence. Published Holocene SWW records at the northern edge of the wind belt (33–41°S) covering South-America, Southern-Africa and Australia, show much variability over the last 6.6 kyr. We suggest this reflects complex regional climate variability in the different SH longitudinal sectors, indicating that SWW are not zonally homogeneous at the northern edge of the wind belt. The recent shift in dust provenance is not accompanied by enhanced total dust deposition at AMS. We therefore suggest that human impact (e.g., land use changes) and drier climate conditions in Southern Africa have led to enhanced dust mobilization. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Amsterdam Island; Anthropogenic activities; Dust sources; Peat; Southern westerly winds"

Human activities have increased atmospheric nutrient fluxes, but the impacts of variability in phosphorus supply on carbon sequestration in ombrotrophic peatlands are unclear. Here, we synthesise phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon stoichiometric data in the surface and deeper layers of mid-latitude Sphagnum-dominated peatlands across Europe, North America and Chile. We find that long-term elevated phosphorus deposition and accumulation strongly correlate with increased organic matter decomposition and lower carbon accumulation in the catotelm. This contrasts with literature that finds short-term increases in phosphorus supply stimulates rapid carbon accumulation, suggesting phosphorus deposition imposes a threshold effect on net ecosystem productivity and carbon burial. We suggest phosphorus supply is an important, but overlooked, factor governing long-term carbon storage in ombrotrophic peatlands, raising the prospect that post-industrial phosphorus deposition may degrade this carbon sink. © 2021, The Author(s).",""

The campo rupestre is a grassy ecosystem of the Cerrado biome, a center of endemism in Brazil with high floristic richness and environmental heterogeneity, where plants have developed multiple adaptive strategies and form a vegetation mosaic shaped by local soil and microhabitat conditions. However, this ecosystem has been under severe land use conversion, while signs of augmenting pressure from climate change are now recorded at faster pace. Thus, understanding the particularities of its multiple habitats is fundamental to define habitat specific references to guide conservation and restoration projects that lead to increased biodiversity. In this work, for the first time, we characterize the floristic composition of the shrub and herbaceous strata and related them to the edaphic characteristics of the four main habitats that form the campo rupestre mosaic: rocky outcrop, stony grassland, sandy grassland, and peat bog. A total of 12,000 m2 of shrub layer (120 plots of 10 × 10 m) and 120 m2 (120 plots of 1 × 1 m) of herbaceous layer were sampled. We recorded 257 species belonging to 47 different families, and also observed a high species turnover among the four different habitats. Furthermore, we identified species from both ends of the edaphic gradient of the four habitats and emphasized the importance of multiregional studies to evaluate the association among species and soils before implementing any restoration project. This study provides the knowledge base to build the reference ecosystems for the mosaic of campo rupestre habitat types. © 2024","Biodiversity hotspot; Ecological restoration; Espinhaço mountain chain; Extreme ecosystem; Habitat heterogeneity; Serra do Cipó"

Two major paleoenvironmental stages were inferred from the combined analysis of elemental, molecular and isotopic biomarkers, with a boundary or transition set at about 3200 yr BP. The first stage was characterized by a relatively low allochthonous organic content, reduced productivity and nitrogen levels. Such paleoenvironmental conditions are interpreted as a terrestrial system under periglacial influence, where material influx was related to erosion process from the melt water discharge, because of the proximity to the Collins Glacier ice cap. After the major Holocene glacier advance dated at about 3500 yr BP, the ice cap retreat led to the formation of Lake Uruguay, which involved in filling processes leading to moraine deposits, proglacial meltwater channels, and lakes next to the land glacier. During the second stage, with the onset of the Current Warm Period, prior to 1900 CE the stabilization of the Zr/Rb ratio within the laminated sediments documented the origin of the lacustrine sedimentation system, with subsequent increases in the sedimentation rate and biomass content (total nitrogen and organic carbon). Time series analyses revealed that the lake displayed variability cycles related to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), as reflected by high resolution sedimentological proxies for grain size, weathering, allochthonous inputs from the watershed, increase of biomass and productivity, and changes in redox conditions, all of which displayed similar oscillation cycles from 2 to 6 yr. During this periglacial recession and associated eutrophication process, we detected a striking loss in both bacterial specific richness and diversity as inferred from preliminary selected ancient DNA analyses. Thus, the Antarctic warming scenario leading to glacier depletion appears to exert deterioration consequences on the Subantarctic microbial web. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ancient DNA; Antarctica; Lipid biomarkers; Paleolimnology; XRF-scanning"

In Peru, this ecosystem is widely threatened owing to the recurrent practice of cutting Mauritia flexuosa palms for fruit harvesting. Such degradation could significantly damage peat deposits by altering C fluxes through fine root productivity, mortality, and decomposition rates which contribute to and regulate peat accumulation. Along a same peat formation, we studied an undegraded site (Intact), a moderately degraded site (mDeg) and a heavily degraded site (hDeg) over 11 months. Fine root C stocks and fluxes were monthly sampled by sequential coring. Concomitantly, fine root decomposition was investigated using litter bags. In the experimental design, fine root stocks and dynamics were assessed separately according to vegetation type (M. flexuosa palm and other tree species) and M. flexuosa age class. Furthermore, results obtained from individual palms and trees were site-scaled by using forest composition and structure. Results: At the scale of individuals, fine root C biomass in M. flexuosa adults was higher at the mDeg site than at the Intact and hDeg sites, while in trees it was lowest at the hDeg site. Site-scale fine root biomass (Mg C ha−1) was higher at the mDeg site (0.58 ± 0.05) than at the Intact (0.48 ± 0.05) and hDeg sites (0.32 ± 0.03). Site-scale annual fine root mortality rate was not significantly different between sites (3.4 ± 1.3, 2.0 ± 0.8, 1.5 ± 0.7 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 at the Intact, mDeg, and hDeg sites) while productivity (same unit) was lower at the hDeg site (1.5 ± 0.8) than at the Intact site (3.7 ± 1.2), the mDeg site being intermediate (2.3 ± 0.9). Decomposition was slow with 63.5−74.4% of mass remaining after 300 days and it was similar among sites and vegetation types. Conclusions: The significant lower fine root C stock and annual productivity rate at the hDeg site than at the Intact site suggests a potential for strong degradation to disrupt peat accretion. These results stress the need for a sustainable management of these forests to maintain their C sink function. © 2021, The Author(s).","Belowground biomass; Decomposition; Necromass; Peatland; Peru; Tropical regions"

It finds that the LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) subsector is important for medium-term mitigation (2020–2030) while continuing to contribute to mitigation over the long-term (2030–2050) in the three countries. Mitigation actions in LULUCF include drastically reducing deforestation (Brazil, Indonesia) and peat degradation (Indonesia), re-/afforestation (all), increased sequestration in standing forests (Brazil, Indonesia) and increasing soil carbon in agricultural lands (India). AFOLU further contributes to mitigation in Brazil and Indonesia by producing biomass feedstock for bioenergy. No country significantly reduces N2O and CH4 emissions from either agriculture or via demand-side actions on diets, due to trade-offs with food security, rural livelihoods and economic growth (although all countries reduce the GHG intensity of agricultural products). Furthermore, the paper analyses national policies to manoeuvre co-benefits and trade-offs between mitigation and other sustainable development goals (SDGs), including no poverty (1); zero hunger (2); decent work and economic growth (8); climate action, including both adaptation and mitigation (13); and life on land (15).

However, the potential for tidal salt marshes to mitigate global warming remains poorly constrained because of the lack of representative sampling of tidal marshes from around the globe, inadequate areal extent estimations, and inappropriate dating methods for accurately estimating C accumulation rates. Here we provide the first estimates of organic C storage and accumulation rates in salt marshes along the Pacific coast of Canada, within the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Clayoquot Sound Biosphere Reserve and Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, a region currently underrepresented in global compilations. Within the context of other sites from the Pacific coast of North America, these young Clayoquot Sound marshes have relatively low C stocks but are accumulating C at rates that are higher than the global average with pronounced differences between high and low marsh habitats. The average C stock calculated during the past 30 years is 54 ± 5 Mg C ha-1 (mean ± standard error), which accounts for 81 % of the C accumulated to the base of the marsh peat layer (67 ± 9 Mg C ha-1). The total C stock is just under one-third of previous global estimates of salt marsh C stocks, likely due to the shallow depth and young age of the marsh. In contrast, the average C accumulation rate (CAR) (184 ± 50 g C m-2 yr-1 to the base of the peat layer) is higher than both CARs from salt marshes along the Pacific coast (112 ± 12 g C m-2 yr-1) and global estimates (91 ± 7 g C m-2 yr-1). This difference was even more pronounced when we considered individual marsh zones: CARs were significantly greater in high marsh (303 ± 45 g C m-2 yr-1) compared to the low marsh sediments (63 ± 6 g C m-2 yr-1), an observation unique to Clayoquot Sound among NE Pacific coast marsh studies. We attribute low CARs in the low marsh zones to shallow-rooting vegetation, reduced terrestrial sediment inputs, negative relative sea level rise in the region, and enhanced erosional processes. Per hectare, CARs in Clayoquot Sound marsh soils are approximately 2-7 times greater than C uptake rates based on net ecosystem productivity in Canadian boreal forests, which highlights their potential importance as C reservoirs and the need to consider their C accumulation capacity as a climate mitigation co-benefit when conserving for other salt marsh ecosystem services.  © 2022 Stephen G.

However, studies on the effects of fires on atmospheric composition, radiative forcing and climate have been limited to date, as the current generation of ES models (ESMs) does not include fully atmosphere-composition-vegetation coupled fires feedbacks. The aim of this work is to develop and evaluate a fully coupled fire-composition-climate ES model. For this, the INteractive Fires and Emissions algoRithm for Natural envirOnments (INFERNO) fire model is coupled to the atmosphere-only configuration of the UK's Earth System Model (UKESM1). This fire-atmosphere interaction through atmospheric chemistry and aerosols allows for fire emissions to influence radiation, clouds and generally weather, which can consequently influence the meteorological drivers of fire. Additionally, INFERNO is updated based on recent developments in the literature to improve the representation of human and/or economic factors in the anthropogenic ignition and suppression of fire. This work presents an assessment of the effects of interactive fire coupling on atmospheric composition and climate compared to the standard UKESM1 configuration that uses prescribed fire emissions. Results show a similar performance when using the fire-atmosphere coupling (the ""online""version of the model) when compared to the offline UKESM1 that uses prescribed fire. The model can reproduce observed present-day global fire emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosols, despite underestimating the global average burnt area. However, at a regional scale, there is an overestimation of fire emissions over Africa due to the misrepresentation of the underlying vegetation types and an underestimation over equatorial Asia due to a lack of representation of peat fires. Despite this, comparing model results with observations of CO column mixing ratio and aerosol optical depth (AOD) show that the fire-atmosphere coupled configuration has a similar performance when compared to UKESM1. In fact, including the interactive biomass burning emissions improves the interannual CO atmospheric column variability and consequently its seasonality over the main biomass burning regions - Africa and South America. Similarly, for aerosols, the AOD results broadly agree with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations.  © Author(s) 2021.",""

These unique cushion plant peatlands are intensively utilized for grazing and are also influenced by climate change, both of which alter hydrologic conditions. Little is known about the natural hydroperiods and greenhouse gas fluxes of these peatlands or the consequences of hydrologic alteration for these fluxes. Therefore, our objectives were to assess how carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes varied across a hydrological gradient caused by ditching and evaluate how short-term carbon cycling responds after rewetting from ditch blocking in a tropical mountain peatland. The study was carried out in Huascarán National Park, Peru using static chamber methods. Comparing reference to highly drained conditions, mid-day net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was higher (1.07 ± 0.06 vs. 0.76 ± 0.11 g CO2 m−2 h−1), and the light compensation point for CO2 uptake was lower. Gas fluxes were relatively stable in the rewetted and reference treatments, with small positive responses of NEE to rising water tables. CH4 emissions averaged 2.76 ± 1.06 mg CH4 m−2 day−1, with negative fluxes at water tables >10 cm below the soil surface, and positive fluxes at higher water levels. Our results indicate that undrained peatlands appear to be carbon sinks, highly drained peatlands were likely carbon sources, and rewetting of moderately drained peatlands increased NEE and the ability to store carbon to undrained reference conditions. Ditching of peatlands will likely increase their susceptibility to negative climate change impacts, and hydrologic restoration could moderate these impacts. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Andes; Bofedales; Carbon cycling; Carbon dioxide; Cushion peatlands; Ditch blocking; Light compensation point; Methane"

In the latter settings, their abundance relative to that of the branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) appears to increase under warmer climate conditions. Furthermore, their relative distribution in bottom sediments from an altitudinal transect of East African lakes has been linked to local mean annual air temperature (MAAT). To shed light on their sources and identify potential environmental factors driving their production in lakes, we investigated their occurrence and distribution in the water column, surficial lake-bottom sediments, and catchment soils of Lake Chala, a permanently stratified (meromictic) tropical crater lake in East Africa. Data from the water column comprise both suspended particulate matter (SPM) collected monthly at eight depth intervals between 0 and 80 m for 17 consecutive months, and settling particles collected monthly at a depth of 35 m over a period of 53 months. In catchment soils, brGMGTs are either relatively scarce or absent. In the water column, their occurrence is dominated by four of the seven known brGMGTs and mostly limited to the anoxic zone. Whereas the spatial distribution and concentration of brGMGTs in SPM were strongly influenced by the seasonal cycle of strong water-column stratification alternating with deep mixing, this trend is not consistent on the multi-year timescale of the settling-particles record. Moreover, their relative distribution in both SPM and settling particles did not respond to temperature variation during the studied interval. In contrast to the water column, surficial lake-bottom sediments contain the full suite of known brGMGTs in a distinct and spatially uniform fractional abundance, strongly suggesting that the majority of brGMGT production takes place there. BrGMGT-inferred MAAT for the Chala area reasonably estimates measured MAAT and conforms to the East African lake brGMGT calibration. Our results have important implications for the use of brGMGTs as proxy for MAAT, in that outside of the equatorial zone the presumably greater offset between bottom-water temperature and MAAT may create a bias towards cold-season air temperature. Regardless, the more singular source of brGMGTs in lake sediments is an advantage for paleotemperature reconstruction compared to brGDGTs, which several studies now indicate to have a mixed aquatic and terrestrial source of which the relative contribution cannot easily be disentangled or assumed to have been constant through time. © 2021 The Author(s)","brGMGTs; East Africa; H-brGDGTs; In situ production; Lake Chala"

This region has elevations up to 6000 m, is characterized by scarce precipitation, high solar radiation receipt, and low air humidity, and has been affected by a severe drought since 2010. In this study, we suggest that most of the snowmelt runoff originates from specific areas with topographic and meteorological features that allow large snow accumulation and limited mass removal. To test this hypothesis, we quantify the spatial distribution of snowmelt runoff and sublimation in a catchment of the semiarid Andes using a process-based snow model that is forced with field data. Model simulations over a 2-year period reproduce point-scale records of snow depth (SD) and snow water equivalent (SWE) and are also in good agreement with an independent SWE reconstruction product as well as satellite snow cover area and indices of winter snow absence and summer snow persistence. We estimate that 50% of snowmelt runoff is produced by 21 %-29% of the catchment area, which we define as ""snowmelt hotspots"". Snowmelt hotspots are located at mid-to-lower elevations of the catchment on wind-sheltered, low-angle slopes. Our findings show that sublimation is not only the main ablation component: it also plays an important role shaping the spatial variability in total annual snowmelt. Snowmelt hotspots might be connected with other hydrological features of arid and semiarid mountain regions, such as areas of groundwater recharge, rock glaciers, and mountain peatlands. We recommend more detailed snow and hydrological monitoring of these sites, especially in the current and projected scenarios of scarce precipitation.  © 2023 Álvaro Ayala et al.",""

We describe plant cover and soil profiles at 31 sites representing the main land cover and landform types in the Veguitas catchment (Cordillera Frontal, Argentina), which ranges in elevation from c. 3000 to 5500 m. The vegetated area with soil development is largely confined to altitudes of < 3650 m and represents only 8.2% of the total catchment area. Mean SOC 0–100 cm storage for the vegetated portion of the catchment is 3.62 kg C m−2, which is reduced to 0.33 kg C m−2 if we consider negligible SOC stocks in the extensive bare ground and glaciated areas at higher elevations. Hotspots of SOC storage are wet meadow areas, with peat deposits up to 102 cm deep and a maximum observed total SOC storage of 53.07 kg C m−2. These wet meadow areas, however, occupy only 0.11% of the total catchment area and their contribution to mean SOC storage is limited. Among soils at well-drained sites, highest mean SOC 0–100 cm storage is found on backslope positions of moraines that predate the Last Glacial Maximum (6.87 kg C m−2). Only 2% of all SOC stocks in the catchment are found in permafrost terrain and none are located in the permafrost layer itself. The main ecoclimatic control on SOC storage is plant cover, with vegetation limits being sensitive to ambient temperature. Projected increases in temperatures will not remobilize any frozen SOC stocks but will likely result in an upward shift of the upper vegetation belt with soil development creating new areas of phytomass carbon and SOC storage. The area is expected to represent a net C sink and thus a negative feedback on future global warming. © 2022 The Authors","Andes; Global warming; Land cover; Landform; Mountain permafrost and periglacial zone; Soil organic carbon"

The paleomagnetic record of the ∼88 m stratigraphic section from Lake Junín was studied, and rock magnetic variability constrained, through analysis of 109 u-channel samples and 56 discrete samples. Downcore variations in sediment lithology reflect climate and hydrological processes over glacial-interglacial time frames and these changes are strongly reflected in the bulk magnetic properties. Glacial sediments are characterized by higher detrital silt content, higher magnetic susceptibility and magnetic remanence values, and a magnetic coercivity that is characteristic of ferrimagnetic (titano)magnetite and/or maghemite. Interglacial sediments and low lake-level facies are dominated by carbonate lithologies and/or peat horizons that result in lower magnetic concentration values. Sediments with moderately high Natural Remanent Magnetization (NRM) intensity (>1 × 10–3 A/m) have well resolved component directions and inclination values that vary around geocentric axial dipole expectations. This remanence value can be used as a threshold to filter the lowest quality paleomagnetic data from the record. Normalized NRM intensity values are also sensitive to lithologic variability, but following NRM remanence filtering, only the highest quality ferrimagnetic dominated data are retained which then show no coherence with bulk magnetic properties. Constrained by the existing radiocarbon based chronology over the last 50 kyrs and 18 U-Th age constraints that are restricted to five interglacial sediment packages, filtered normalized remanence parameters compare well with global relative paleointensity stacks, suggesting relative variations in geomagnetic intensity are preserved. By adjusting the existing age-depth model we improve the correlation between the Junín normalized intensity record and a well-dated RPI stack and RPI model. We then incorporate these paleomagnetic tie points with the existing radiometric dates using a modeling approach to assess uncertainty and refine the age-depth model for Lake Junín. In combining relative and radiometric dating, the new age-depth model captures glacial-interglacial variations in sedimentation rate and improves the orbital-scale age model for the sediments accumulated in Lake Junín basin over most of the Brunhes. © Copyright © 2020 Hatfield, Stoner, Solada, Morey, Woods, Chen, McGee, Abbott and Rodbell.","age models; chronology; lake sediments; paleomagnetism; RPI; stratigraphy"

Avoiding the construction of the road alongside the Tigre river would therefore prevent the loss of 83 462.58 ha of forests and the emission of 41.49 Mt CO2-eq from 2019 to 2030. Therefore, the Peruvian government should assess alternative proposals for transportation in this area. For example, improved fluvial boat services could be used for the transport of cargo and people, while an air taxi service could also help to meet the needs of indigenous communities and riverine settlers. Compliance with international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will potentially be impossible if the road is constructed as it is estimated that will increase national emissions by 1.31 % from 2019 to 2030. The funds saved from not constructing the road could subsidize the use of a modern river fleet, the air taxi service and the implementation of conservation strategies and sustainable management of the Amazonian forests and peatlands of the Tigre river. © 2020 Institute of Investigations of The Peruvian Amazon - IIAP.

To design effective conservation and restoration policies, maps of the location and carbon storage of tropical peatlands are vital. This is especially so in countries such as Peru where the distribution of its large, hydrologically intact peatlands is poorly known. Here field and remote sensing data support the model development of peatland extent and thickness for lowland Peruvian Amazonia. We estimate a peatland area of 62,714 km2 (5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles of 58,325 and 67,102 km2, respectively) and carbon stock of 5.4 (2.6–10.6) PgC, a value approaching the entire above-ground carbon stock of Peru but contained within just 5% of its land area. Combining the map of peatland extent with national land-cover data we reveal small but growing areas of deforestation and associated CO2 emissions from peat decomposition due to conversion to mining, urban areas and agriculture. The emissions from peatland areas classified as forest in 2000 represent 1–4% of Peruvian CO2 forest emissions between 2000 and 2016. We suggest that bespoke monitoring, protection and sustainable management of tropical peatlands are required to avoid further degradation and CO2 emissions. © 2022, Crown.",""

However, these palms are felled to harvest the fruits, which has led to reduced resource availability due to the pressure exerted by the increasing fruit demand. As a result, climbing has been proposed as a means to harvest the fruits sustainably. However, the long-term ecological and socio-economic impacts of climbing, rather than felling, palms remain unknown. We evaluate whether M. flexuosa populations and fruit production in managed peatland palm swamps have recovered within two rural communities in Peru where climbing to harvest palm fruits was adopted between 1999 and 2002. Since then, these communities have been supported by conservation and development projects. We conducted interviews with community members to assess perceptions of change since the introduction of climbing and carried out forest inventories to estimate changes in two socio-economic indicators (volume of harvested M. flexuosa fruits and income) and three ecological indicators (pole stem density of M. flexuosa, seedling and sapling density, and the sex ratio of adult palms). Our results reveal that the adoption of climbing has improved the health of the forest stands and incomes in both rural communities. Recovery of M. flexuosa populations was supported by local perceptions of increases in stand productivity, improved values of most indicators within managed stands compared to reference data from unmanaged stands in the region, and continuous recovery of degraded stands over time following the adoption of climbing by both communities. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate how long-term conservation and development initiatives can lead to successful outcomes for rural communities and peatland ecosystems. However, urgent adoption of sustainable harvesting techniques, such as the palm climbing in our study, is needed across Amazonia to safeguard the ecological integrity of peatlands, below carbon storage, and livelihoods. This transition will require long-term collaboration among different stakeholders, affordable management plans, and fair prices for sustainable management for peatland resources.

However, the ecology of these peatlands and the environmental factors that control their carbon dynamics remain under-studied. Here we report on the patterns of root biomass productivity and turnover rates for two cushion plant species (Distichia muscoides, Plantago rigida) that commonly dominate high-elevation peatlands (> 4200 m a.s.l.) in the Andean páramo landscape of Northern Ecuador. Root biomass for P. rigida ranged from 680 to 864 g m-2 and was approximately 40 % higher than for D. muscoides (507–620 g m-2). In contrast, root production was almost twice as high for D. muscoides (2000–2800 g m-2 yr-1) than for P. rigida (1030–1080 g m-2 yr-1). These patterns resulted in high root turnover rates, especially for D. muscoides (0.98–1.90 yr-1). Below-ground productivity (as C) at our sites conservatively ranged from 0.55 to 1.5 kg m–2 yr–1, representing approximately 30 % of the estimated total productivity for these species, which only accounts for root production down to 50 cm depth. These high productivity rates are in accordance with the extremely high rates of carbon accumulation that have been reported for high-elevation peatlands of the Andes. © 2021, IMCG and IPS.

Given the totipotency of vegetative tissue of many bryophytes, birds could also contribute to endozoochorous bryophyte dispersal. Research has shown that fecal samples of the upland goose (Chloephaga picta) and white-bellied seedsnipe (Attagis malouinus) contain bryophyte fragments. Although few fragments from bird feces have been known to regenerate, the evidence for the viability of diaspores following passage through the bird intestinal tract remains ambiguous. We evaluated the role of endozoochory in these same herbivorous and sympatric bird species in sub-Antarctic Chile. We hypothesized that fragments of bryophyte gametophytes retrieved from their feces are viable and capable of regenerating new plant tissue. Eleven feces disk samples containing undetermined moss fragments from C. picta (N = 6) and A. malouinus (N = 5) and six moss fragment samples from wild-collected mosses (Conostomum tetragonum, Syntrichia robusta, and Polytrichum strictum) were grown ex situ in peat soil and in vitro using a agar Gamborg medium. After 91 days, 20% of fragments from A. malouinus feces, 50% of fragments from C. picta feces, and 67% of propagules from wild mosses produced new growth. The fact that moss diaspores remained viable and can regenerate under experimental conditions following the passage through the intestinal tracts of these robust fliers and altitudinal and latitudinal migrants suggests that sub-Antarctic birds might play a role in bryophyte dispersal. This relationship may have important implications in the way bryophytes disperse and colonize habitats facing climate change. © 2021 The Authors.

Sediment core COL17–1, section 1470–800 cm depth shows five distinct diatom intervals offering insights into environmental changes and ecological characteristics based on sediment sources, diatom productivity, and bog wetness. Colônia basin evolution exhibited a progressive transition from mineral elements, associated with catchment instability during the lake stage, to higher levels of organic-rich sediments towards the uppermost section of the core. This shift was accompanied by the increasing presence of elements reflecting redox/productivity dynamics under changing conditions. Simultaneously, Br concentrations increased during peat formation indicating alterations in organic matter were influenced by atmospheric circulation and precipitation. During the transition from lake to peatland, the paleolake shallowing process showed successive colonization by benthic acidophilus diatom taxa, indicating a broader littoral zone and subsequent disappearance of diatoms under dry conditions. After a benthic stage, the diatom content shifted to one of planktonic dominance characterized by Aulacoseira sp., marking the return to cold-wet conditions and a moderately deep, flooded environment. Subsequently, the basin evolved into a completely flooded, turbulent peatland dominated by the Aulacoseira granulata complex. An uppermost layer sterile in diatom was associated with warmer and drier conditions and decrease in the concentration of mineral elements. Present results compared with core CO14 and Lake Titicaca showed benthic-rich levels during the penultimate glacial period and low benthic abundances. This differed the glacial-interglacial transition from those of COL17–1, which was dominated by planktonic-rich levels, suggesting the need for either a reassessment of our age model or the influence of local factors on diatom content. These findings highlight the sensitivity of diatoms to climate shifts, particularly in tropical regions, across different glacial-interglacial cycles. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Diatoms; Paleoclimate; Sediment cores; Southern hemisphere; Trace elements; Tropics"

Such long-term records are required to reconstruct and better understand the likely regional impacts of a poleward shift and intensification of the SWWs predicted under global warming scenarios. Deglaciation at Punta Burslem occurs sometime before c. 17,000 cal a BP, and the post glacial landscape is dominated by cold tolerant pioneer species. Nothofagus woodland is established by c. 12,250 cal a BP, this moisture sensitive vegetation type retreats in the early to mid-Holocene from c. 9700 to 7050 cal a BP reflecting an intense and sustained drier phase associated with a prolonged poleward contraction of the SWWs. After c. 6000 cal a BP there is a regional trend to cooler and wetter climate. However, we identify at least five periods of rapid climate change (RCC) leading to drier conditions at this southern extreme of Patagonia: c. 5350-4750 cal a BP, c.4300-3300 cal a BP, c. 2600-1850 cal a BP, c. 1350-1100 cal a BP and c. 550-350 cal a BP. From a synthesis of our Isla Navarino records and a latitudinal spread (34°-64°S) of multiproxy records it is proposed that these periods of RCC and relatively drier conditions indicate latitudinal shifts in the location and intensity of the SWWs in response to climatic warming leading to reduced precipitation at the southern margins of Patagonia. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Holocene; Palaeogeography; Pollen analysis; Pollen preservation; Rapid climate change; South America; Southern westerly winds; Vegetation dynamics"

Peatlands form over thousands of years, where waterlogged conditions result in accumulation of organic matter. Vast areas of Southeast Asian peatlands have been impacted by land use change and fires, whilst lowland tropical peatlands of Central Africa and South America remain largely hydrologically intact. To predict accurately how these peatlands may respond to potential future disturbances, an understanding of their long-term history is necessary. This paper reviews the palaeoecological literature on tropical peatlands of Southeast Asia, Central Africa and South America. It addresses the following questions: (i) what were the past ecological dynamics of peatlands before human activity?; (ii) how did they respond to anthropogenic and natural disturbances through the palaeoanthropocene, the period from whence evidence for human presence first appeared?; and, (iii) given their past ecological resilience and current exposure to accelerating human impacts, how might the peatlands respond to drivers of change prevalent in the anthropocene? Through synthesising palaeoecological records, this review demonstrates how tropical peatland ecosystems have responded dynamically, persisting through fire (both natural and anthropogenic), climatic and human-induced disturbances in the palaeoanthropocene. Ecosystem resilience does, however, appear to be compromised in the past c. 200 years in Southeast Asian peatlands, faced with transformative anthropogenic impacts. In combination, this review's findings present a pantropical perspective on peatland ecosystem dynamics, providing useful insights for informing conservation and more responsible management. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropocene; Carbon; Climate change; Drainage; Fire; Palaeoanthropocene; Palaeoecology; Tropical peat"

Stretched between these two systems is a NW-SE-oriented region dominated by descending air masses, resulting in the South American subtropical dry zone (SASDZ), also known as the arid diagonal. We investigated the Cerro Tuzgle cushion peatland (CTP) located on the Argentine Altiplano, north of the present-day SASDZ. Previous work revealed that the CTP was consistently in the SASM regime during the last 2900 cal yr BP. Here, we extend the CTP record to the middle Holocene covering the last 7200 cal yr BP to gain further knowledge of the Holocene development of the SASM and potential modulations of the SASDZ. The prominent feature of the entire record is a distinct and lasting transition centred around 3100 cal yr BP characterized by declining minerogenic content, increasing organic carbon content, rising stable carbon isotope values of organic matter and cellulose, and increasing stable oxygen isotope values of cellulose. We interpret this specific proxy pattern as a hydroclimatic transition towards less arid conditions at the CTP after 3100 cal yr BP. The transition corresponds with the end of the continuous Holocene strengthening of the SASM between 3500 cal yr BP and 3000 cal yr BP indicated by proxy records from north and east of the CTP. The CTP does not reflect this strengthening of the SASM and rather exhibits a threshold response indicating the effective establishment of the SASM summer precipitation regime at 24˚S. This suggests that moisture supply during a more arid middle Holocene was provided by isotopically depleted precipitation, while moisture supply after the transition originated from isotopically enriched SASM summer precipitation. Concurrent hydroclimatic changes in the SHW winter precipitation regime south of the SASDZ are documented in a distinct lake level rise of Laguna Aculeo (33˚50´S) around 3200 cal yr BP. These coinciding hydrological changes of the SASM and the SHW precipitation regimes indicate larger scale reorganisations of atmospheric circulation components, potentially connected to major modulations of the SASDZ. Thus, our CTP record sheds light on the middle to late Holocene development of the SASM at its southern limit and corroborates connections between the tropical and extratropical hydroclimate of South America. © 2022 Lücke et al.

A globalized scene has shifted production to new countries from Africa, Asia, and South America. Sustainability is the major challenge for ornamental production, and the life cycle assessment (LCA) provides insights on environmental contributions from production to handling and transportation and highlights the problematic issues that need improvement. For example, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the production costs of roses in different parts of the world may vary dramatically between different production processes (e.g., heated or non-heated greenhouses, with or without air transportation, etc.). On the other hand, the production of landscape plants has the lowest environmental impact of all floricultural products. Their long production period offers carbon sequestrations that reduce the total GHG emissions. Sustainability is achieved via critical adjustments on cultivation by minimizing fuel and electricity use, adopting integrated nutrient management (INM) and integrated pest and disease management (IPDM), and using recyclable materials and peat-alternative growing compounds. In this review, two possible scenarios were proposed for ornamental production. Scenario I suggests conventional, protected cultivation under controlled environments (i.e., greenhouses), which can be sustainable after implementing appropriate adjustments to reduce environmental outputs. Scenario II suggests the cultivation of native and specialty ornamental crops, which may serve as eco-friendly alternatives. Combinations between the two scenarios are also possible in view to implement sustainable practices and meet future consumer needs. © 2020 by the author.","CO2 footprint; Environmental impact; Floriculture; Global warming; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment; Phalaenopsis; Roses"

Here, we studied the metagenomes of three geochemically distinct peatlands spanning minerotrophic, mixed, and ombrotrophic conditions. Using gene- and genome-centric approaches, we evaluate the functional potential of the underlying microbial communities. Abundance analyses show significant differences in C, N, P, and S acquisition genes. Furthermore, community interactions mediated by toxin–antitoxin and CRISPR-Cas systems were enriched in oligotrophic soils, suggesting that non-metabolic interactions may exert additional controls in low-nutrient environments.

Our analyses detail key differences across the geochemical gradient in the predicted microbial populations involved in degradation of organic matter, and the cycling of N and S.

Total NPP in the palm forest and hardwood-dominated forest (9.83 ± 1.43 and 7.34 ± 0.84 Mg C ha−1 year−1, respectively) was low compared with values reported for terra firme forest in the region (14.21–15.01 Mg C ha−1 year−1) and for tropical peatlands elsewhere (11.06 and 13.20 Mg C ha−1 year−1). Despite the similar total NPP of the two forest types, there were considerable differences in the distribution of NPP. Fine root NPP was seven times higher in the palm forest (4.56 ± 1.05 Mg C ha−1 year−1) than in the hardwood forest (0.61 ± 0.22 Mg C ha−1 year−1). Above-ground palm NPP, a frequently overlooked component, made large contributions to total NPP in the palm-dominated forest, accounting for 41% (14% in the hardwood-dominated forest). Conversely, Mauritia flexuosa litter decomposition rates were the same in both plots: highest for leaf material, followed by root and then stem material (21%, 77% and 86% of mass remaining after 1 year respectively for both plots). Our results suggest potential differences in these two peatland types' responses to climate and other environmental changes and will assist in future modelling studies of these systems. © 2024 The Author(s).

Chemical and morphological characterization of the samples was carried out using various analytical techniques, and total levels of 53 elements were determined. Furthermore, a chemometric differentiation based on the elemental content of peat and moss samples was performed. Some elements (Cs, Hf, K, Li, Mn, Na, Pb, Rb, Si, Sn, Ti and Zn) showed significantly higher contents in moss samples than in peat samples. In contrast, only Mo, S and Zr were significantly higher in peat samples than in moss samples. The results obtained highlight the ability of moss to accumulate elements and to act as a means to facilitate the entry of elements into peat samples.

This review considers the sources arsenic to soils and its subsequent fate, identifying key knowledge gaps. There is a particular focus on soil classification and stratigraphy, as this is central to the topic under consideration. For Europe and North America, peat core chrono-sequences record massive enhancement of arsenic depositional flux from the onset of the Industrial Revolution to the late 20th century, while modern mitigation efforts have led to a sharp decline in emissions. Recent arsenic wet and dry depositional flux measurements and modern ice core records suggest that it is South America and East Asia that are now primary global-scale polluters. Natural sources of arsenic to the atmosphere are primarily from volcanic emissions, aeolian soil dust entrainment, and microbial biomethylation. However, quantifying these natural inputs to the atmosphere, and subsequent redeposition to soils, is only starting to become better defined. The pedosphere acts as both a sink and source of deposited arsenic. Soil is highly heterogeneous in the natural arsenic already present, in the chemical and biological regulation of its mobility within soil horizons, and in interaction with climatic and geomorphological settings. Mineral soils tend to be an arsenic sink, while organic soils act as both a sink and a source. It is identified here that peatlands hold a considerable amount of Anthropocene released arsenic, and that this store can be potentially remobilized under climate change scenarios. Also, increased ambient temperature seems to cause enhanced arsine release from soils, and potentially also from the oceans, leading to enhanced rates of arsenic biogeochemical cycling through the atmosphere. With respect to agriculture, rice cultivation was identified as a particular concern in Southeast Asia due to the current high arsenic deposition rates to soil, the efficiency of arsenic assimilation by rice grain, and grain yield reduction through toxicity. © 2021 American Chemical Society","Anthropocene; Arsenic; Arsines; Atmosphere; Biogeochemical cycling; Biovolatilization; Oceans; Soils; Trimethylarsine oxide"

Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are unique bacterial lipids that have been proposed as universal paleothermometers due to their correlation with temperature in modern settings. Thus, brGDGTs may serve as a crucial paleotemperature proxy for understanding past climate variations and improving regional climate projections, especially in critical but under constrained regions. That said, complications can arise in their application due to varying source contributions (e.g., soils vs. peats vs. lacustrine). As such, this study investigates brGDGT distributions in Chilean lake surface sediments and corresponding watershed soils to determine the source of brGDGTs to lake sediments. Global datasets of brGDGTs in lake sediments and soils were additionally compiled for comparison. Distinct brGDGT distributions in Chilean lakes and soils indicate minimal bias from soil inputs to the lacustrine sediments as well as in situ lacustrine production of brGDGTs, which supports the use of brGDGTs in lake sediments as reliable paleotemperature proxies in the region. The ΣIIIa/ΣIIa ratio, initially promising as a brGDGT source indicator in marine settings, shows global complexities in lacustrine settings, challenging the establishment of universal thresholds for source apportionment. That said, we show that the ratio can be successfully applied in Chilean lake surface sediments. Direct comparisons with watershed soils and further research are crucial for discerning brGDGT sources in lake sediments and improving paleotemperature reconstructions on regional and global scales moving forward. Overall, this study contributes valuable insights into brGDGT variability, essential for accurate paleoreconstructions.

Studies of these environments are scarce, and estimates of CO2 fluxes are poorly constrained. In this study, we use two independent methods for measuring gas transfer velocity (k), a critical variable in the estimation of CO2 evasion and other biogeochemical processes. The first method, kinematic k600 (k600-K), is derived from an empirical relationship between temperature-adjusted k (k600) and the physical characteristics of the stream. The second method, measured k600 (k600-M), estimates gas transfer velocity in the stream by in situ measurements of dissolved CO2 (pCO2) and CO2 evasion to the atmosphere, adjusting for temperature. Measurements were collected throughout a 5-week period during the wet season of a peatland-stream transition within a páramo ecosystem located above 4000 m in elevation in northeastern Ecuador. We characterized the spatial heterogeneity of the 250-m reach on five occasions, and both methods showed a wide range of variability in k600 at small spatial scales. Values of k600-K ranged from 7.42 to 330 m/d (mean = 116 ± 95.1 m/d), whereas values of k600-M ranged from 23.5 to 444 m/d (mean = 121 ± 127 m/d). Temporal variability in k600 was driven by increases in stream discharge caused by rain events, whereas spatial variability was driven by channel morphology, including stream width and slope. The two methods were in good agreement (less than 16% difference) at high and medium stream discharge (above 7.0 L/s). However, the two methods considerably differed from one another (up to 73% difference) at low stream discharge (below 7.0 L/s, which represents 60% of the observations collected). Our study provides the first estimates of k600 values in a high-elevation tropical catchment across steep environmental gradients and highlights the combined effects of hydrology and stream morphology in co-regulating gas transfer velocities in páramo streams. © 2021 The Authors.","carbon budget; CO<sub>2</sub> evasion; gas transfer velocity; high elevation; mountain streams; topical páramo"

Spatial models for total soil C and CO2 were calculated using discrete and continuous variables. The annual mean of measured cumulative CO2 was 1,358 µg CO2 g soil−1, lower than Northern peatlands, and 82% of the C mineralization occurred in the warmer season. The modelled CO2 in the warmer season showed levels of CO2 as high as 4 mg CO2 g soil−1, but 66% of the area showed between 600–2000 µg CO2 g soil−1, which is 28%–92% and 9%–32% of CO2 values reported for crop rotations.

The largest expanses of tropical peatlands are located in lowland areas of Southeast Asia and the Amazon basin. The Loreto Region of Amazonian Peru contains ~63,000 km2 of peatlands. However, little is known about the biogeochemistry of these peatlands, and in particular, the cycling of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), and their responses to hydrometeorological forcings. To address these knowledge gaps, we established an eddy covariance (EC) flux tower in a natural palm (Mauritia flexuosa L.f.) swamp peatland near Iquitos, Peru. Here, we report ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 flux observations for this Amazonian palm swamp peatland over a two-year period in relation to hydrometeorological forcings. Seasonal and short-term variations in hydrometeorological forcing had a strong effect on CO2 and CH4 fluxes. High air temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) exerted an important limitation on photosynthesis during the dry season, while latent heat flux appeared to be insensitive to these climate drivers. Evidence from light-response analyses and flux partitioning support that photosynthetic activity was downregulated during dry conditions, while ecosystem respiration (RE) was either inhibited or enhanced depending on water table position. The cumulative net ecosystem CO2 exchange indicated that the peatland was a significant CO2 sink ranging from −465 (−279 to −651) g C m−2 y−1 in 2018 to −462 (−277 to −647) g C m−2 y−1 in 2019. The forest was a CH4 source of 22 (20 to 24) g C m−2 y−1, similar in magnitude to other tropical peatlands and larger than boreal and arctic peatlands. Thus, the annual carbon budget of this Amazonian palm swamp peatland appears to be a major carbon sink under current hydrometeorological conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Amazonian peatland; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Eddy covariance; Methane; Palm swamp"

Here we report that in unexplored peat soils of Central and South America, N2O production can be driven by abiotic reactions (≤98%) highly competitive to their enzymatic counterparts. Extracted soil iron positively correlated with in situ abiotic N2O production determined by isotopic tracers. Moreover, we found that microbial N2O reduction accompanied abiotic production, essentially closing a coupled abiotic-biotic N2O cycle. Anaerobic N2O consumption occurred ubiquitously (pH 6.4–3.7), with proportions of diverse clade II N2O reducers increasing with consumption rates. Our findings show that denitrification in tropical peat soils is not a purely biological process but rather a ‘mosaic’ of abiotic and biotic reduction reactions. We predict that hydrological and temperature fluctuations differentially affect abiotic and biotic drivers and further contribute to the high N2O flux variation in the region. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",""

Forest fires in Canada destroyed more than 15.6 million hectares of forests. These wildfires worsened air quality across the region and other parts of the world. The smoke reached southern Europe by the end of June 2023. To better understand the consequences of such forest fires far from the site of origin, aerosol optical, microphysical and radiative properties were analyzed during this event for southern Europe using data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). TROPOMI aerosol index (AI) and the carbon monoxide (CO) product confirm that the smoke originated directly from these forest fires. AERONET data from the El Arenosillo site in southern Spain showed maximum aerosol optical depth (AOD) values on June 27 reached 2.36. Data on Angstrom Exponent (AE), aerosol volume size distribution (VSD), single scattering albedo (SSA), fine mode fraction (FMF), volume particle concentration, effective radius (REff), absorption AOD (AAOD), extinction AE (EAE) and absorption AE (AAE) showed that fine-mode particles with carbonaceous aerosols contribution predominated in the atmosphere above the El Arenosillo site.

This research investigates whether the presence of a subsurface peat/lagoon clay layer significantly impacts permeability and influences shoreline displacement in the coastal region of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The methodology included categorizing the study areas based on coastline displacement, barrier evolution trends, and the presence of peat/lagoon clay. Permeability data was collected and statistically analyzed. The results show that the presence of a peat/lagoon clay layer at a higher depth does not influence the permeability coefficient, and no correlation exists between permeability and shoreline displacement. Additionally, permeability showed higher values at the berm, near the shoreface, potentially due to vehicle traffic at the backshore. These findings suggest that permeability is not the link that connects erosion on different time scales in the region. The study contributes new permeability data and emphasizes the importance of refining models for predicting beach permeability and erosion, besides highlighting the need for broader consideration of other factors in shaping coastal dynamics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Barrier; Beach; Erosion; Hydraulic conductivity; Peat"

The signatures of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 show strong variability at the poles that has not yet been resolved at lower latitudes. This work discusses one of the first terrestrial records that reflects the vegetation, glacier, and climate conditions in southern South America during this period. The stratigraphic, palynological, and geomorphological features of the Punta Pihuío, Río Huicha, Punta Pirquén and Punta Detico sites (41–42° S) on the Isla Grande de Chiloé (southern Chile) are described and discussed. Glacially sourced sediment intercalated with peat soils constrained by single-grain feldspar (SGIR50) luminescence and radiocarbon (14C) dating show that the Late MIS 5 and the MIS 3 were periods of high environmental variability at these locations. Pollen records from peat layers indicate an open forest with conifers, Nothofagus and thermophilic elements, such as Myrtaceae, representing interstadial conditions that were abruptly interrupted by glacial expansions during stadials. High variability between arboreal and herbaceous taxa is also interpreted as environmental instability. Moreover, we show that the Patagonian Ice Sheet (PIS) reached full glacial extent during Early to Middle MIS 3, as is also observed in other Southern Hemisphere glacier records on both sides of the Pacific Ocean.

Forests and peatlands store the largest amount of C because of their large stocks per hectare and the large area they cover. The total amount of C stored per unit area varies from 261.7 to 432.8 Mg C ha−1, depending on the published value used for soil organic C stocks in peatlands, highlighting the need to have more precise estimates of the C stored in this and other ecosystems.

One of the few exceptions is the Hg record of Pinheiro mire (souheast Brazil). Previous studies on this mire modeled mercury using principal components regression and partial least squares. These methods assume independence between factors, which is seldom the case in natural systems, thus hampering the identification of mediating effects and interactions. To overcome these limitations, in this reserach we use structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to model mercury and bromine peat records - bromine has been used in some investigations to normalize mercury accumuation. The mercury model explained 83% of the variance and suggested a complex control: increased peat decomposition, dust deposition and humid climates enhanced mercury accumulation, while increased mineral fluxes resulted in a decrease in mercury accumulation. The bromine model explained 90% of the variation in concentrations: increased dust deposition and peat decomposition promoted bromine accumulation, while time (i.e. peat age) promoted bromine depletion. Thus, although mercury and bromine are both organically bound elements with relevant atmospheric cycles the weights of the factors involved in their accumulation differed significantly. Our results suggest caution when using bromine to normalize mercury accumulation. PLS-SEM results indicate a large time dependence of peat decomposition, catchment mineral fluxes, long-term climate change, and atmospheric deposition; while atmospheric dust, mineral fluxes and peat decomposition showed high to moderate climate dependency. In particular, they also point to a relevant role of autogenic processes (i.e. the build up and expansion of the mire within the catchment), which controlled local mineral fluxes; an aspect that has seldom been considered. © 2020","Bromine; Late Pleistocene-Holocene; Mercury; Structural equation modeling"

Despite their importance, they have a long history of use and impacts including drainage for agriculture and grazing, and water withdrawal for human uses. Here we present a preliminary assessment of the conservation status of páramo peatlands in Ecuador and, using a case study, discuss peatland restoration as a tool for mitigation and adaptation to the impacts of current climate change. Through a simple index assessing the cumulative presence of signs of human activities on 163 peatland sites, we found that the level of impact was higher for peatlands located in the Western branch of the cordillera, whereas current human population density, precipitation, and elevation were not significant predictors of the levels of impact. Also, starting in 2017, we implemented a pilot restoration initiative on a 21-ha peatland which had been drained and converted into pasture for at least 150 years. The restoration consisted of two ditch blocking techniques implemented to stop fast-moving water and promote the rewetting of the peatland. During the next 3 years, water table increased from 27 ± 3 cm below the soil surface to 7 ± 1 cm by 2021, while wetland plant communities are colonizing and closing the pools in the blocked ditches. Re-wetting of the peatland has led to an increase in the abundance of native species. This case study suggests that restoration initiatives are an efficient and cost-effective approach to a better management of páramo peatlands, with high potential as a tool for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. © 2022, The Author(s).","Andes; Ecuador; Human impact; Peatlands; Páramo; Restoration"

The majority of the world's peatlands are in temperate and boreal zones, whereas tropical ones cover only a total area of 90–170 Mha. However, there are still considerable uncertainties in C stock estimates as well as a lack of information about depth, bulk density and carbon accumulation rates. The incomplete data are notable especially in tropical peatlands located in South America, which are estimated to have the largest area of peatlands in the tropical zone. This paper displays the current state of knowledge surrounding tropical peatlands and their biophysical characteristics, distribution and carbon stock, role in the global climate, the impacts of direct human disturbances on carbon accumulation rates and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Based on the new peat extension and depth data, we estimate that tropical peatlands store 152–288 Gt C, or about half of the global peatland emitted carbon. We discuss the knowledge gaps in research on distribution, depth, C stock and fluxes in these ecosystems which play an important role in the global carbon cycle and risk releasing large quantities of GHGs into the atmosphere (CO2 and CH4) when subjected to anthropogenic interferences (e.g., drainage and deforestation). Recent studies show that although climate change has an impact on the carbon fluxes of these ecosystems, the direct anthropogenic disturbance may play a greater role. The future of these systems as carbon sinks will depend on advancing current scientific knowledge and incorporating local understanding to support policies geared toward managing and conserving peatlands in vulnerable regions, such as the Amazon where recent records show increased forest fires and deforestation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon cycling; climate change; greenhouse gas emissions; land-use change; tropical peatlands"

The COL17c record is composed of two main sub-units deposited under different regimes: a peatland above ~14 m and lacustrine sediments below. Sedimentary description and core scanning (MSCL and XRF) are first used to align individual cores in order to produce a nearly continuous composite record. We then established an original chronological framework based on radiocarbon, paleomagnetic, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence at elevated temperature (pIRIR290°C) and authigenic 10Be/9Be dating. We describe the protocols used for each technique and discuss the positive and negative results, as well as their implications for proxy interpretation. In spite of negative results of some techniques, mainly due to the absence of adequate sample material, the multi-proxy approach used is essential to maximize the chances of obtaining a satisfactory age model for this unique continental sedimentary sequence. All valid chronological proxies, comprising three AMS 14C ages, one pIRIR290°C age, two paleomagnetic constraints and eight authigenic 10Be/9Be datum, are integrated within a Bayesian age-depth modeling to produce a 1.5 ± 0.1 Ma chronology for the whole COL17c sequence. This age model represents the first long-term chronological estimate of sediments deposition in the Colônia basin.

This research focused on evaluating how human impact and environmental factors affect the development of Solanum peruvianum in its natural habitat of coastal lomas. The study was carried out in the coastal lomas of Mangomarca-Peru, where phenotypic and ecological data on the plants were collected. Information was also gathered on human impacts on the nutritional characteristics of the soils. Then, five types of organic amendments were used to improve the physical and chemical characteristics of the degraded soil, and the development and photosynthetic activity of S. peruvianum were evaluated. As a result, under the study conditions, it was found that S. peruvianum was established approximately 33.74 cm from the rocks, in a range of 300 to 650 m asl. The maximum height of the plants was 90 cm, with a stem diameter at ground level of 2 cm. S. peruvianum produced fruits between January and July, with a seed germination rate of 36% in 25 days. On the other hand, the anthropogenic impact on the soil reduced 58% of organic material (OM), 71% of nitrogen, 40% of P2O5, and 13% of K2O and increased the concentration of magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, pH, and electric conductivity (EC). The organic amendments bokashi, compost, and biochar, when mixed with the degraded soil, increased the pH, OM, N, P, and EC; however, the plants died after 25 days. On the other hand, the application of the Premix5 substrate for 100 days favored the growth of 52.84 cm and 38.29 cm in the preserved soil and 23.21 cm in the black soil mixed with blond peat, and it should be noted that the substrates presented an acid pH and EC > 0.1. Regarding photosynthetic phenotyping, S. peruvianum plants grown in their natural habitat and in Premix5 showed a higher proton flux (vH+), linear electron flow (LEF), and maximum quantum yield (Fv’/Fm’). On the contrary, they showed a lower NPQt value than plants grown in preserved and black soil mixed with blond peat. © 2024 by the authors.","degraded soils; organic amendments; photosynthesis; restoration of degraded areas"

A key source of uncertainty is the asynchrony of ice lobe fluctuations between the northern, central, and southern PIS. To fully understand the regional trends requires careful mapping and extensive geochronological studies. This paper presents geomorphological and geochronological reconstructions of the glacial and deglacial landforms formed during the last glacial period at the Seno Skyring lobe, southernmost Patagonia (52°S, 71°W). We present a detailed geomorphological map, where we identify two moraine systems. The outer and older is named Laguna Blanca (LB) and the inner Río Verde (RV). The LB moraines were built subaerially, whereas parts of the RV were deposited subaqueously under the palaeo lake Laguna Blanca, which developed during deglaciation. We conducted surface exposure 10Be dating methods on boulder samples collected from LB and RV glacial margins. The moraine LB III and LB IV formed at 26.3 ± 2.3 ka (n = 5) and 24.3 ± 0.9 ka (n = 3), respectively. For the inner RV moraine, we obtained an age of 18.7 ± 1.5 ka (n = 6). For the palaeo Laguna Blanca evolution, we performed 10Be exposure ages on shoreline berms and optically stimulated luminesce dating to constrain the lake levels, and 10Be depth profile dating on an outwash deposit formed by a partial lake drainage event, which occurred at 22 ± 3 ka. For the RV moraine deglaciation, we performed radiocarbon dating of basal sediments in a peat bog, which indicates that the glacier retreated from the terminal RV moraine by at least c. 16.4 cal kyr BP. Our moraine geochronology shows an asynchrony in the maximum extents and a different pattern of ice advances between neighbouring lobes in southern Patagonia. We speculate that this may be due, at least in part, to the interaction between topography and the precipitation carried by the southern westerly wind belt. However, we found broad synchrony of glacial readvances contemporaneous with the RV moraine.

Thus, we tested the fine-scale effects of abiotic filters (i.e. soil physicochemical properties and depth) on species richness and community composition in complex rocky outcrop landscapes at the Roraima table mountain summit. This tepui is located on the triple boundary shared by Brazil, Venezuela and Guyana. A total of 60 plots were allocated in three specific previously identified geoenvironments: Peaty Rupestrian Grassland, Bonnetia-Shrubby Rupestrian Grassland and Sandy Rupestrian Grassland. Overall, 4318 individuals were sampled, distributed among 60 species, especially belonging to the families Asteraceae and Bromeliaceae. Of this total, 27 (45%) species are endemic to GH. There were significant differences among the geoenvironments regarding species richness, community composition and soil attributes. The tested models demonstrated that species richness was influenced by variations in potential acidity; however, community composition was explained mainly by soil texture and depth effects.

Similar to the concept of endemic soils, they are restricted to specific geographic areas due to a unique combination of soil-forming factors. In this contribution, we aim to improve the pedological knowledge of the Brazilian highlands, focusing on well-drained organic soils. The objective was to propose a soil formation scheme for the study area, combining traditional techniques and paleoenvironmental reconstruction (phytoliths, isotypes, dating). Organic soils were formed by litter accumulation in two pedoenvironments: (1) directly on bedrock in the high-elevation grasslands, by the processes of addition and transformation of the litter, which constitute the parent material from these soils; and (2) in upper-montane forests, with organic horizons formed above mineral horizons. In both conditions, the cold and humid climate and vegetation (organisms) are the main soil-forming factors, reducing organic matter decomposition, and influencing the physical and chemical soil properties. Phytolith records and isotopic composition of soil organic matter indicated four environmental phases: Phase I (before ∼18,9k yr BP). A cooler and drier climate than present, with predominance of subtropical grassland vegetation and fire events; Phase II (∼18,9k yr BP to ∼11,1k yr BP). A slightly increase of humidity, decrease of fire events, and expansion of forest formations, with rare presence of Araucaria angustifolia; Phase III (from ∼11,1k years BP) increase in humidity, the establishment of current climate conditions (cold and humid climate, typical of Southeastern Brazilian highlands), and significant presence of Araucaria in upper-montane forests; Phase IV (present) environmental changes related to increased fire events, reduction of Araucaria and increase of Bambusoid, Arecaceae and C4 plants, possibly resulted from human activities.

The rock-slope stability response to receding ice masses and the contribution of the gravitational processes in landscape evolution of the southernmost Andes, however, have not been assessed so far. The remoteness of the region, comprising a mountainous area hardly to access and piedmont and valley floors densely covered by forest, peatbogs or water bodies might partly explain the lack of such studies. Therefore, the objective of this contribution is to document for the first time the occurrence of massive slope failures in the Fuegian Andes using a multidisciplinary approach. This involves the use of indirect methods such as applied geophysics and landscape morphometrics. The southwest-facing slope of Cerro Guanaco, near Ushuaia, hosts several slope failures, but a massive failure stands out. The morphostructural approach allowed the geometrical description of the main dimensional characteristics of the first megalandslide recognized in the Fuegian Andes, which involved almost 1,2 km3 of material. On the other hand, the geophysical data has proved valuable in estimating the depth and characteristic of the buried detachment surface. The slope failure consisted of an initial translational movement followed by secondary slides and was developed shortly after the glacier recession.

However, the species’ regeneration within its native habitat has been hindered by a confluence of factors such as climate change, agricultural activities, and shifts in land use. Coupled with the seeds’ low germination rate and protracted emergence period, the necessity to develop large-scale propagation methods to bolster P. boldus population numbers has become increasingly evident. Furthermore, the widespread use of P. boldus for medicinal purposes renders it vulnerable to overexploitation, thereby underscoring the need for a comprehensive mass propagation protocol to support conservation efforts. Thus, the main objective of this study was to formulate an in vitro protocol for mass regeneration of P. boldus. The explants excised from nodal sections demonstrated an average survival rate of 74%, while the application of 6-benzylaminopurine (4.44 μM) yielded an average shoot length of 5.9 cm. In vitro shoot rooting achieved a success rate of 80% using perlite supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid (9.84 μM). During the acclimation phase, in vitro rooted plants displayed a remarkable 100% survival rate at the 30-day mark after being transplanted into a substrate consisting of perlite and peat in a (1:1 v/v) ratio. © 2023 by the authors.","boldo; ecological restoration; in vitro cultivation; medicinal plant; micropropagation; native flora; woody plant"

Drainage systems are therefore essential for the productive use of these soils, though these may induce soil shrinkage/subsidence. The aim of this work was to evaluate the shrinkage potential and curves of Aquands along a longitudinal climatic gradient in southern Chile (from 38° to 42° S). Methods: Undisturbed and disturbed soil samples of five soil series under pasture were collected in metallic cylinders and plastic bags, respectively, from two soil depths (0–20 and 20–40 cm). A peat soil was also used as a reference of a soil with a high shrinkage capacity that has not historically suffered water stress. Shrinkage curves were measured and their phases were determined. Soil shrinkage parameters, bulk density, air capacity, soil organic carbon (SOC), and extractable aluminum (Ala) were also determined. Results: From north to south, as the SOC increased, the shrinkage potential of the soils increased as well. Shrinkage curves showed clear structural and wide proportional shrinkage, with an absence of zero shrinkage. The hydraulic stress caused by drainage affected the pore shrinkage capacity and could lead to high subsidence and, in turn, a decrease in soil depth. Conclusions: Aquands showed a very high shrinkage capacity (COLE < 0.09), which was positively related to their OC content and negatively related to the initial bulk density of the soil. After drying events (− 500 hPa), Aquands reached a volume decrease of up to 25%, reflecting a low resilience capacity that, in turn, affects the soil physical properties, i.e., structure, subsidence, and soil depth. The observed increase in shrinkage processes in the Ñadi soil transect may be due to the accumulated OC content created by the extremely waterlogged conditions associated with the edaphoclimatic conditions under which these soils were developed. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.","Aquands; Organic carbon; Soil physical properties; Soil shrinkage"

The influence of microtopography (lawns and hummock-hollow complexes) in the biogeochemical dynamics of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC) and dissolved CH4 and CO2 is generally miss-considered. Southernmost Patagonia has huge areas of pristine peatlands, which are still in a largely natural state with scarce anthropogenic influence. In this study we provide foundational insights into the dynamics of greenhouse gasses (GHGs) and DOC in Sphagnum dominated peatlands of Southern Patagonia, assessing the impact of microtopography on these dynamics. The stocks of dissolved GHGs and DOC in hummock-hollows complex and lawns were analysed at three depths (25, 50, and 75 cm) in four ombrotrophic peatbogs. CH4, N2O and CO2 fluxes, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary productivity (GPP) were also studied. CO2 and CH4 fluxes were strongly affected by microtopography. Hummock-hollows showed higher CO2 fluxes, and temperature and radiation were the main drivers for respiration and GPP, respectively. In addition, in this microtopography, higher DOC concentrations were observed at the top depth. In contrast, lawns acted as a source of CH4, with higher emission rates and high dissolved GHGs concentration throughout the depth profile. © 2024 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences","Carbon dioxide; Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem respiration; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Tierra del Fuego"

We conducted a national-level synthesis of Canadian restoration ecology research to understand strengths and gaps. This synthesis answers the following questions: Who is studying restoration? What ecosystem types are studied? Where is restoration studied? Which themes has restoration research focused on? Why is restoration happening? And how is restoration monitored and evaluated? We employed systematic searching for this review. Our results show that restoration research is conducted mainly by academics. Forest, peatland, grassland, and lake ecosystem types were the most commonly studied. There was a concentration of research in four provinces (Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, and British Columbia). Research into restoration has changed its thematic focus over time from reforestation to climate change. Legislation was the most common reason given for restoration. Restoration research frequently documented results of less than 5 years of monitoring and included one category of response variable (e.g., plant response but not animal response). Future research could investigate the outcomes of restoration prompted by legislation.

Restoration via re-wetting could play an important role in climate change mitigation, reducing CO2 emissions and increasing C storage within peatlands. However, re-wetting leads to a biogeochemical compromise between increased CO2 uptake, and enhanced methane (CH4) release. The extent of this compromise in re-wetted ecosystems with differing environmental conditions is uncertain. To assess re-wetting effects, we analyzed eddy-covariance flux measurements from a temperate bog near Vancouver, Canada, from two sites that have undergone different restoration techniques. By the end of the 1-year study period, the actively re-wetted, wetter site, was a weak CO2 sink (−26.1 ± 6.1 g C-CO2 m−2), and the passively re-wetted, drier site, was near CO2 neutral (3.8 ± 3.1 g C-CO2 m−2). Higher CH4 emissions at the wetter site led to a larger radiative balance on 20- and 100-year time horizons, implying that the strong radiative effect of CH4 can offset CO2 sink strength on shorter to medium timeframes. However, long-term radiative forcing (RF) modeling suggests sustained CO2 uptake by the wetter site will eventually lead to a cooling effect on the climate. Furthermore, modeling results emphasize that despite both re-wetted peatland sites having a positive RF over century timescales, the lack of restoration would have resulted in a significantly larger RF beyond the first few decades following restoration. Results highlight the importance of actively re-wetting disturbed peatlands to mitigate climate warming and can be used to inform management decisions. © 2022. American Geophysical Union.

These characteristics become mutually related as enzymatic activities increase with temperature and are associated with oxygen penetration, restricting the activity of many hydrolytic enzymes according to the enzyme Latch Theory. This study describes the changing activity of sulfatase (Sulf), phosphatase (Phos), n-acetyl-glucosaminidase (N-Ac), cellobiohydrolase (Cellobio), β-glucosidase (β-Glu), and peroxidase (POX) on an altitudinal scale from 3600 to 4200 m, in rainy and dry seasons at 10 and 30 cm sampling depth, related to physical and chemical soil characteristics, like metals and organic elements. Linear fixed-effect models were established to analyze these environmental factors to determine distinct decomposition patterns. The data suggests a strong tendency towards decreasing enzyme activities at higher altitudes and in the dry season up to two-fold stronger activation for Sulf, Phos, Cellobio, and β-Glu. Especially the lowest altitude showed considerably stronger activity of N-Ac, β-Glu, and POX. Although sampling depth revealed significant differences for all hydrolases but Cellobio, it had minor effects on model outcomes. Further organic rather than physical or metal components of the soil explain the enzyme activity variations. Although the levels of phenols coincided mostly with the soil organic carbon content, there was no direct relation between hydrolases, POX activity, and phenolic substances. The outcome suggests that slight environmental changes with global warming might cause important changes in enzyme activities leading to increased organic matter decomposition at the borderline between the paramo region and downslope ecosystems. Expected extremer dry seasons could cause critical changes as aeration increases peat decomposition leading to a constant liberation of carbon stocks, which puts the paramo region and its ecosystem services in great danger. © 2023","Climate change; Enzyme latch; Extracellular enzyme activity; Soil"

We used 132 paired samples from the same peat cores to compare the composition of testate amoeba assemblages between the two methods and evaluate the potential of palynological testate amoeba records as quantitative paleohydrological proxies in peatlands. Our results suggest that the palynological treatments (acetolysis, 10% KOH and 150 µm sieving) substantially reduce test concentrations, diversity and richness in most pollen-slide samples. The smaller sieve size used in the palynological treatment (i.e. 150 µm) removed only a small fraction of the total tests, but could introduce a species-specific bias in assemblage composition. However, major shifts between wet and dry conditions, as shown by the water table depth (WTD) reconstructions using wet-sieved samples, were relatively well captured by the palynological datasets in most instances. The palynological assemblages with counts of >50 tests (n = 30) provided WTD estimates similar to those inferred from the wet-sieved samples as the most dominant hydrophilous and xerophilous taxa were relatively well represented in the pollen-slide samples in the two studied peat cores. Testate amoeba data from pollen slides can provide useful paleohydrological information particularly when combined with other paleoenvironmental proxies. Nonetheless, if the goal is to generate quantitative paleohydrological reconstructions, we recommend that testate amoeba analyses be conducted using the wet-sieving method, as testate amoeba concentrations, diversity and richness are typically much lower in samples prepared with palynological treatments. © The Author(s) 2020.","non-pollen palynomorphs; paleohydrological records; peat profiles; pollen slides; testate amoebae; water table depth; wet-sieving method"

However, large uncertainties persist regarding their feedbacks to climate variations. The Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM) is an ongoing state-of-the-science model, which has developed new representations of soil hydrology and biogeochemistry and includes a new microbial-functional-group-based CH4 module. This model has been tested in boreal forest peatlands, but has not yet been evaluated for simulating energy and carbon exchange for tropical peatlands. Here, we evaluated the ELM performance in simulating energy, carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 fluxes of an Amazonian palm swamp peatland in Iquitos, Peru. ELM simulations using default parameter values resulted in poor performance of seasonal carbon dynamics. Several algorithms were improved according to site-specific characteristics and key parameters were optimized using an objective surrogate-assisted Bayesian approach. The modified algorithms included the soil water retention curve, a water coverage scalar function for CH4 processes, and a seasonally varying leaf carbon-to-nitrogen ratio function. The revised tropics-specific model better simulated the diel and seasonal patterns of energy and carbon fluxes of the palm swamp peatland. Global sensitivity analyses indicated that the strong controls on energy and carbon fluxes were mainly attributed to the parameters associated with vegetation activities, such as plant carbon distribution, stomatal regulation, photosynthetic capacity, and leaf phenology. Parameter relative importance depended on biogeochemical processes and shifted significantly between wet and dry seasons. This modeling study advanced the understanding of biotic controls on the energy and carbon exchange in Amazonian palm swamp peatlands and identified knowledge gaps that need to be addressed for better prediction of carbon cycle processes and budgets for tropical peatlands. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Amazon; Land surface model; Methane; Peatland; Phenology; Tropics"

In this paper, we investigated the late Holocene record of vegetation change, peatland evolution, and C accumulation based on analysis of a sediment core through a Mauritia-flexuosa palm dominated swamp (locally called “aguajal”) in the Madre de Dios region in southern Peru to better understand tropical peatland dynamics. Sedimentation commenced within shallow water, ponded on an impervious substrate, perhaps within an abandoned river channel or oxbow lake (1380–820 cal yr BP) located adjacent to a steep escarpment with terra firme (upland) rainforest above and lateral to floodplain forests. This was followed by the development of marsh (820–640 cal yr BP). A closed-canopy Mauritia flexuosa-dominated palm swamp was subsequently established (640300calyr BP) which later changed into an open canopy and mixed Mauritia-Hedyosmum palm swamp (300 cal yr BP to present). Two major changes in peat and C accumulation rates were observed: (1) onset of peat and C accumulation at 820 cal yr BP and (2) decrease of peat and C accumulation after 520 cal yr BP. Comparisons of our results with palaeoecological records from aguajales in northern Peru suggest that the dynamics were different in this region.

This study aims to understand the source of the coal organic matter and to distinguish depositional sub-environments along the coal-bearing interval from the southern border of the basin. The analysis was performed on sedimentological and stratigraphic data from 10 wells combined with organic petrology and geochemistry of the three coal beds. Samples were collected in different key beds from the SG-14 well, in different and strategic depths at the base (218.0 m), at the intermediate (209.0 m), and at the top (181.0 m) of the coal-bearing interval. The vitrinite reflectance measurements of the selected samples, Tmax values, C29 ααα 20 S/(20 S + 20 R) ratio, and the absence of peak Ts (and presence of peak Tm) revealed the organic matter in the coal-bearing interval is thermally immature, suggesting low burial depth for the Rio Bonito Formation in the study region. Maceral composition showed predominance of vitrinite and inertinite in the three coal samples. Rock-Eval pyrolysis data indicate that the coal beds are composed of type III kerogen in the three samples, while the biomarkers indicate type II-III kerogen mixtures. The n-alkane distribution profiles suggest dominance of terrestrial organic matter in the samples, with a possible marine contribution at the top of the coal-bearing interval. The pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph) and C27/C29 ααα20 R ratios (regular steranes) revealed sub-anoxic condition and land plants as major organic matter source for basal and intermediate parts of the coal-bearing interval. They also indicate an increased anoxic conditions and possible marine algal contribution toward the uppermost coal level. The presence of cone-in-cone-shaped structures (SG-07 well, depth 157.5 m) and Orbiculoidea fossils (SG-14 well, depth 192.5 m) are indicative of brackish water and support river-marine source mixtures at the top of the coal-bearing interval. The evolutive sedimentation model comprises four paleoenvironments for the Rio Bonito Formation along geological time, in which the basal part of the coal interval is interpreted as overbank deposits in a fluvial depositional system. On the other hand, the intermediate part of the coal-bearing interval was formed in bay-head delta, and the upper part was deposited in the central estuary, both in a tide- and wave-influenced estuarine context. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Biomarkers; Coal; Coastal deposits; Cone-in-cone structure; Estuary; Rio bonito formation"

While most peatlands start developing as fens, a large fraction of them eventually shift to bogs in a step-like ecosystem shift. This transition has traditionally been assumed to be primarily controlled by the ecosystem itself (autogenic control). Here we use 90 peat profiles from southernmost South America (SSA) as a case study that illustrates a synchronous, regional-scale shift from fen to bog around 4200 years ago. In light of these results, we propose and discuss conceptual models that link environmental change (allogenic control) as a trigger to the fen-bog transition (FBT). In addition, our stratigraphic analyses show that Sphagnum deposits are associated with greater peat masses, larger soil-carbon stocks, and higher rates of peat-carbon accumulation than their non-Sphagnum counterparts, with Sphagnum bogs being characterized by soil-carbon densities over twice that of non-Sphagnum peatlands (medians = 141 vs. 56 kgC/m2). Since fens and bogs also behave differently in terms of their carbon exchanges with the atmosphere, a better appraisal of the processes involved in the FBT could help elucidate the role of this critical ecosystem shift in the past and future global carbon cycle. © Copyright © 2020 Loisel and Bunsen.","carbon sink function; complex adaptive system; Holocene; Mires; Paleoecology; regime shift; tipping point"

We present 1-year variations in dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations and fluxes in eight river catchments differing in size (3–300 km2), morphology (steep to flat), and vegetation cover (grassland, forest and peatland) along a precipitation gradient in southern Patagonia, Chile. The results show large differences between catchments in terms of river DOC (2–47 mg L−1; 1–44 tons km−2 year−1) and DIC (0.1–38 mg L−1; 1–5 tons km−2 year−1) concentrations and fluxes in response to changes in discharge. Small and steep catchments hosting organic rich forest soils and peatlands were the most sensitive and showed the highest and fastest DOC release if evaluated on a per unit area basis. Here, rain events caused a rapid exponential increase in DOC release, while DIC export decreased exponentially. A negative correlation between DOC and DIC reveals the minor importance of DIC production through mineralization of DOC in most catchments. Catchments hosting large peatlands had low sensitivity to discharged controlled DOC release attributed to their high hydrological buffer capacity. Similarly, flat and relatively dry Patagonian steppe catchments have comparatively low sensitivity but have short-term high release of DOC accumulated during dry periods. In conclusion, morphology, rather than catchment size or vegetation cover, was found to show the major influence on sensitivity to DOC release. © 2022, The Author(s).","Controlling factors catchment morphology; River catchments; Sensitivity to dissolved carbon releases"

Because humic substances impair sensory processes, the current study tested the hypothesis that O2 and/or CO2 chemoreception is impeded in blackwater owing to the presence of HA. Thus, the ventilatory responses of tambaqui to hypoxia or hypercapnia were assessed in well water transported from Manaus, local blackwater, and in well water containing HA either extracted from Rio Negro water or obtained commercially (Sigma Aldrich; SA). In well water, tambaqui exhibited typical hyperventilatory responses to hypoxia or hypercapnia. These responses were prevented by simultaneously exposing fish to SA HA (20 mg l−1). The negative effects of SA HA on ventilation were prevented when natural DOC (30 mg l−1; extracted from Rio Negro water after first removing the endogenous HA fraction) was added concurrently, indicating a protective effect of this non-humic acid DOC fraction. The hyperventilatory responses were unaffected during acute exposure or after acclimation of fish to Rio Negro water. HA extracted from Rio Negro water did not impair the hyperventilatory responses to hypoxia or hypercapnia.

Their high abundance across the landscape and thick carbon (C)-rich soils establish them as regionally important C reservoirs. However, they are at high risk of degradation due to unsustainable land use and climate change. Mitigation of these threats requires detailed inventories of C stocks present and improved understanding of the major drivers of long-term C accumulation in these ecosystems. We cored 24 peatlands located between 3000 and 4800 m elevation across Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, calculated C storage and long-term and recent apparent rate of C accumulation (LARCA and RARCA, respectively), and tested their relationships to environmental variables (elevation, temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation). The peatlands had a mean thickness of 4.7 m (range, 0.7‒11.25 m). The mean age of peatland was 7918 yrs B.P., with a range from 490 to 20,000 yrs B.P. The mean C stock was 1743 Mg ha-1 and did not significantly vary by climatic region or basal age but did increase with elevation. LARCA was best predicted by age and elevation, while RARCA was negatively related to mean annual temperature. These findings indicate that peatlands in the tropical Andes store thick deposits of soil C that are likely influenced by temperature, making them vulnerable to changes in climate. To inform climate policy, there is a need for science that will determine the potential for adaptation and mitigation treatments to increase the resilience of these C-rich ecosystems to climate change. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Accumulation rate; Andes; Carbon; Mountain peatlands; Peat"

In hydromorphic podzols, DOM reacts mainly with aluminium (Al), which is responsible for the formation of the Bh-horizon in the subsoil. In this work, we investigated whether the retention of DOM in the soil during the podzolization process is selective in relation to the molecular composition of DOM. A column experiment was conducted to study the selective retention of sorption and desorption processes under controlled conditions. Materials used in the column experiment were representative for Brazilian coastal podzols under tropical rainforest. Materials were collected from this tropical coastal podzol ecosystem, and included soil from E- and Bh-horizons, and DOM from a stream (Stream), peat water (Peat), litter (Litter) and charred litter (Char). To evaluate selective retention of DOM, both the initial DOM and its leachates were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectra absorption (FTIR) and pyrolysis gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The results showed preferential retention of DOM associated with biopolymers for soil columns with E-horizon material (E), E with Al nitrate (E-n), E with kaolinite (E-k) and E with gibbsite (E-h), except for Char. The composition of leachates after percolation through B horizon columns was mainly determined by desorption, and had a relatively large contribution from phenolic and carboxylic groups associated with Al and low molecular weight aromatic and N-containing pyrolysis products, while products from macromolecular materials such as cellulose were selectively retained in the columns for all DOM types. DOM from the Stream (taken during the rainy season) resembled that of desorbed OM from the B columns, reinforcing substantial desorption in the field as well. Our results suggest that sorption and desorption of OM in the hydromorphic Bh-horizon is continuous and that the selectivity of sorption is dependent on DOM source. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Desorption; DOM-metal binding properties; Experimental pedology; Natural organic matter; Podzolization; Tropical coastal podzols"

Lake sediment and peat have been the most widely used archives; however, new records from ice, tree rings, and the measurement of Hg stable isotopes, are offering new insights into past Hg cycling. Preindustrial Hg deposition has been studied over decadal to millennial timescales extending as far back as the late Pleistocene. Exploitation of mercury deposits (mainly cinnabar) first began during the mid to late Holocene in South America, Europe, and Asia, but increased dramatically during the Colonial era (1532–1900) for silver production. However, evidence for preindustrial Hg pollution is restricted to regions directly downwind or downstream of cinnabar or precious metal mining centers. Excluding these areas, there has been an approximately four-fold increase in atmospheric deposition globally over the industrial era (i.e., since 1800–1850), though regional differences exist, especially during the early 20th Century. Lake sediments, peat, ice, and tree rings are all influenced by (and integrate) a range of processes. For example, lake sediments are influenced by atmospheric deposition, sediment focusing, and the input of allochthonous material from the watershed, peat records reflect atmospheric deposition and biotic uptake, ice cores are a record of Hg scrubbed during precipitation, and tree rings record atmospheric concentrations. No archive represents an absolute record of past Hg deposition or concentrations, and post-depositional transformation of Hg profiles remains an important topic of research. However, natural archives continue to provide important insight into atmospheric Hg cycling over various timescales. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental archives; Ice; Lake sediment; Mercury; Peat; Tree rings"

The studied bog lacks complicating features often posed by other bogs. It is completely dominated by Sphagnum magellanicum, which covers all niches and growth forms, and is joined by only a dozen higher plant species; it is entirely ombrotrophic with very sharp borders to the surrounding fen; it has only one type of peat that shows an only limited range in degree of decomposition; and it is situated in a very even climate with minimal differences in rainfall and temperature over the year. We present detailed measurements along a 498-m-long transect crossing the bog, including water table measurements (n = 498), contiguous vegetation relevés (n = 248), hydraulic conductivity just below the water table (n = 246), and hydraulic conductivity in 11 depth profiles (n = 291); degree of humification of the corresponding peat was assessed in conjunction with the hydraulic conductivity measurements (n = 537). Sphagnum magellanicum moss samples were collected every 2 m along this transect as well and genotyped (n = 242). In addition, along short, 26-m-long transects crossing strings and flarks water table and hydraulic conductivity just below the water table were measured every meter. Sphagnum growth forms were assessed, and the vegetation of the entire bog was mapped in 10 × 10-m relevés (n = 3322). A simulation model was applied to a generalized shape of the bog and produced surface patterns that well matched those seen in the field. The results were integrated with information from the literature and discussed in the framework of a self-regulating and self-organizing raised bog. We identified 19 hydrological feedback mechanisms. We found that the various mechanisms overlap in both space and time, which means there is redundancy in the self-regulation of the system.

This systematic literature review evaluates the current understanding of the snail's environmental preferences to identify factors which might aid control and areas where further research is needed. Searches were conducted using Google Scholar and PubMed and included papers published up to August 2023. After filtration, 198 papers with data from 64 countries were evaluated, and data regarding habitat type and habitat pH were noted, along with any other information pertaining to the snail's environmental preferences.

However, there is limited understanding of the impact of several factors, such as the true optimum pH and temperature preferences within the respective tolerance limits or the reason for the snail's apparent aversion to peatland.

However, this C store is vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, leading these ecosystems to become weaker C sinks or even net C sources. Variabilities in water table (WT) greatly influence the magnitude of greenhouse gas flux in these biomes. Despite its importance in C cycling, observations of the spatiotemporal dynamics of tropical peatland WT are limited in spatial extent and length. Here, we use in situ WT measurements from tropical peatlands in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Peru to evaluate the satellite-based Optical Trapezoid Model (OPTRAM). The model uses the pixel distribution in the shortwave infrared transformed reflectance and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) space to calculate indices that are then compared against in situ WT data. 30-m resolution Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 images were utilized for model parameterization. We found OPTRAM to best capture tropical peatland WT dynamics in minimally forested and non-forested areas (low to intermediate NDVI) (0.7 < R < 1) using the “best pixel” approach (the pixel with the highest Pearson-R correlation value). In areas with relatively higher NDVI, OPTRAM index did not correlate with WT (average R of −0.04 to 0.24), likely due to trees being less sensitive to WT fluctuations. OPTRAM shows potential for reliably estimating tropical peatland WT without the need for direct measurements, which is challenging due to site remoteness and harsh conditions. © 2024.

This chamber, called the ""skirt chamber"", is based on a transparent plastic film placed above an open frame made of sparse interwoven wires and expanded around the base of the chamber below a steel chain that ensures contact to the ground, avoiding damage, trenching, and cutting vegetation. Gas exchange is determined using a portable gas analyzer from a mass balance in which the imperfect sealing of the chamber to the ground is quantified through the injection of a methane pulse. The method was tested on a pristine peatland dominated by Sphagnum magellanicum located on Navarino Island in the subantarctic Magellanic ecoregion in Chile. Our results indicate that the skirt chamber allowed the determination of methane fluxes and ecosystem respiration in about 20 min, with a limit of detection of 0.185 mg CH4 m-2 h-1 and 173 mg CO2 m-2 h-1, respectively. We conclude that the skirt chamber is a minimally intrusive, fast, portable, and inexpensive method that allows the quantification of greenhouse gas emissions with high spatial resolution in remote locations and without delay.  © Copyright: ",""

Watersheds draining temperate rainforests, peatlands, glaciers, and three large rivers that flow from the drier interior of the Yukon Territory and British Columbia discharge water and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into southeast Alaskan coastal waters. This area, which we have designated the southeast Alaska drainage basin (SEAKDB), discharges about twice as much water as the Columbia or Yukon Rivers. An understanding of the timing, location, and source of water and DOC guides research to better understand the influence of terrestrial outputs on the adjacent marine systems. Additionally, a spatially extensive understanding of riverine DOC flux will improve our understanding of lateral losses related to terrestrial carbon cycling. We estimate 1.17 Tg C yr−1 of DOC enters the adjacent marine system along with 430 km2 of freshwater that influences estuary, shelf, and Gulf of Alaska hydrology. We estimate that 23% to 66% of the DOC entering coastal waters is bioavailable and may influence metabolism and productivity within the marine system. The combination of the large and spatially distributed water and DOC input, long and complex shoreline, large enclosed estuarine volume, and bounded nearshore coastal currents suggests that the physiographic structure of southeast Alaska may have a significant impact on the metabolism of riverine DOC in coastal marine ecosystems. ©2020.

However, the effects of improvements on tropical soils contaminated by potentially toxic metals and metalloids (PTMs) in mining areas remain largely unknown. This paper reports on a pot experiment conducted with peat, compost, and biochar, together with soil and slag containing high concentrations of PTMs from an abandoned mine site (Ribeira Valley, Brazil). Mixtures of slag, soil, and amendments altered the geochemical fractionation and, in most improvements, resulted in positive changes in maize (Zea mays) growth, which may be due to the lower bioavailability of contaminants and/or the greater supply of nutrients. The germination rate was less sensitive to the effect of the improvements, with values greater than 75%. However, the addition of 10% biochar resulted in 0% germination. Contaminants were present in the roots of all samples, but they were observed exclusively in the shoots of certain plants. The combination of bioconcentration factor (BCF) < 1 and translocation factor (TF) < 1 suggests mechanisms that limit the uptake of metals and metalloids from the soil, with minimal translocation to the shoots of plants. Regarding ecological risk, improvements were notable with the addition of 10% compost (resulting in lower risks for Cd, Pb, Zn, and Co) and with 5% peat + compost + biochar (resulting in lower risks for Pb, Zn, As, and Ni). The results of ACE and Chao1 for the improvements were equal to or greater than those for soil and slag, indicating the amendments tended to increase species richness. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, and Actinobacteriota phyla were identified in the improvements and the presence of amendments altered the soil bacterial community at the genus level. Although peat, compost, and biochar (including their combined use) are promising alternatives for PTMs contaminated soils, the addition rates must be adjusted correctly for avoiding undesirable ecotoxicological effects. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Bacterial community; Biochar; Compost; Peat; PTM; Remediation; Zea mays"

In order to evaluate this capacity, we determined the total organic carbon (TOC wt%) and the maturity of soil organic matter (SOM) by calculating the maximum vitrinite reflectance (Ro max). Additionally, batch-reactor experiments, water leaching and ultrasonication were conducted to study the sorption and desorption process. The mangrove soil presents a TOC content of 25% and a humification range of SOM that has reached the range of peat. Sorption isotherms were nonlinear following the Freundlich model. The values of the isotherm nonlinearity index (N) and organic carbon normalized sorption coefficients (log Koc) are similar for fluorene and phenanthrene; therefore, they follow the same sorption mechanism in the mangrove soil. The log Koc values obtained suggest that the soil is composed of a mixture of both recent organic matter and organic matter with an advanced degree of maturity. For this reason, for both polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the process responded to a non-linear model with limited sorption sites with variable potential energy. Both fluorene and phenanthrene presented a desorption percentage between 6-7% in mangrove soil sample. This allows us to infer that the bonds presented in the sorption process are associated with the insertion of fluorene and phenanthrene into the pores of the humified mangrove soil material. The research into mangrove soil displayed significant heterogeneity in composition and strong sorption of PAHs, as a result, mangrove soil presents natural filters in this area of the Venezuelan Caribbean.  © 2021 by The Geochemical Society of Japan.","fluorene; Freundlich isotherm; organic soil; phenanthrene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons"

As a result, it was possible to determine and quantify the main constituent elements of the peatland and the chronology of paleoenvironmental changes. Five phases of paleoenvironmental changes were inferred: Phase I – 8.9 to 6.6 cal kyr BP - cold local environment (high phytolith index), which was very wet (higher tree cover density and high occurrence of C3 plants) and with watershed instability (higher incidence of erosion and sedimentation); Phase II – 6.6 to 3.9 kyr - very cold local environment, with reduced moisture in relation to the previous phase (decrease of the temperature and mixture of C3 and C4 plants), and increased stability in the watershed, with episodes of erosion at the end of the phase; Phase III – 3.9 to 2.1 cal kyr BP – warmer, drier local environment in relation to the previous phase (increase in the temperature and decrease of tree cover density) and instability in the watershed, with an episode of temperature decrease and moisture increase (respective increase in the climatic phytolith index and in δ15N) in the middle of the phase; Phase IV – 2.1 to 0.25 kyr - colder climate, increased humidity in the local environment in relation to the previous phase (increase in Ic% and D/P and a decrease in the palm cover density phytolith index), and greater stability in the watershed; Phase V – 0.25 kyr to present - increase in temperature, decrease in humidity (decrease in Ic% and expansion of C4 plants), and increased instability in the watershed, possibly influenced by human activity.

Indonesia and Brazil have experienced high rates of deforestation fires in recent years, with many of the fires burning in peatland-rich ecosystems. We quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the 2019 and 2020 deforestation fires in both countries and determine the share of emissions originating from peatlands. Specifically, we use publicly available data for deforested area estimates and quantify the above-ground biomass (AGB), dry matter, and peat soil emissions associated with these fires. We find that the cumulative emissions impact from deforestation fires in Indonesia and Brazil was 3.7 (±0.4) and 1.9 (±0.2) Gt CO2eq in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Nearly half of this GHG impact can be attributed to emissions from peatlands. However, real-time monitoring tools can underestimate these emissions as fires in peatlands smolder underground and can go undetected by satellites. We compare our results with publicly available land-use and fire emissions data and find that the magnitude of underestimation is of the order of 200–300% for severe fire years and highest in the peatland-rich Brazilian Pantanal. We identify the gaps in current policies that are exacerbating the GHG and climate impacts of deforestation fires in Indonesia and Brazil and emphasize the need for regular pre- and post-fire ground measurement, transparent data sharing, and robust policy enforcement for effective forest and peatland protection.

However, a comprehensive assessment is hampered by fragmentary knowledge of the locations of peat-covered areas and this, in turn, prevents their protection and restoration in the face of ongoing anthropogenic destruction. The study reported here reviewed research activities on peatlands in Amazonia, which started with ecological studies in the 1950s. We found a broad and significant thematic increase since 2009, with growing focus first on carbon accumulation and greenhouse gas fluxes then, after 2017, on degradation and conservation, along with a spatial imbalance in favour of the Peruvian lowlands. Hitherto, very little scientific attention has been directed towards the peatlands of western Brazil, the Bolivian lowlands and the Guianas. Most research in Amazonia has been conducted by international institutions with, in recent times, increasing contributions from local institutes and research groups. Nevertheless, research on Amazonian peatlands is still in its early stages, and several scientific questions remain unanswered. Advancing the knowledge base with respect to various scientific disciplines (e.g., ecology, biology, geography, social sciences and economics) is, therefore, essential for understanding how and where peatlands developed, how they are used, which ecosystem services they provide, how climate change will affect them and, finally, what would be the most appropriate conservation, restoration and sustainable use strategies for safeguarding the wellbeing of both peatlands and people. © 2024, IMCG and IPS.

Isolated and clustered leaves are the dominant fossils; reproductive organs, conductive tissues (Agathoxylon-type wood), and Vertebraria roots were less frequently described. The material is mostly preserved as impressions, very rarely as petrifactions or compressions. The oldest leaf patterns within the studied interval show the dominance of the Gangamopteris over Glossopteris during the final stages of deglaciation (307.7 ± 3.1 Ma) and the increasing dominance of Glossopteris during the early Permian peat-deposition cold temperate interval (295.8 ± 3.1–304.0 ± 5.6 to 285.42 + 1.2/−2.1 Ma), when the glossopterids reached their acme under low CO2 paleoatmospheric levels. The conservative morphography of the leaves in almost all the studied intervals contrasts with distinct patterns of ovuliferous structures related to the genera Arberia, Ottokaria, and Plumsteadia. The persistence of Glossopteris as a component of floristic associations in the Kungurian and Roadian after the disappearance of environmental and climatic conditions favorable to the development of extensive peatlands during the Asselian–Artinskian interval attests to the remarkable adaptative capacity of these plants. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",""

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the International Biological Flora including distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic and environmental factors, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, conservation and global heterogeneity. Festuca dolichophylla is a tall perennial tussock grass that thrives at high elevations. It is native and widely distributed along the Andes of South America. It also occurs in North and Central America, especially in Mexico and Costa Rica. Festuca dolichophylla plays a significant role in Andean ecosystems and communities of Ecuador, Perú, Bolivia and northern Argentina. It serves various purposes, primarily as food source for South American camelids such as llama and alpaca. Festuca dolichophylla is dominant in Altiplano (Andean high plains) grasslands and is also present in Bofedales (Andean peatlands), shrublands and possibly in Ecuador and Colombia paramos. Festuca dolichophylla reproduces through seeds and vegetative tillers. Flowering tillers bear panicles with multiple spikelets and florets. An ungrazed plant can produce as much as 15.6 g of seeds during May and June, and seeds can germinate in 7 days or more. Festuca dolichophylla exhibits physiological and ecological traits that enable it to thrive in harsh environmental conditions, including extreme temperatures, drought and nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in a range of soil types from strongly acid to slightly alkaline, encompassing textures that include loamy, sandy clay loam, clay loam and clay, and which are influenced by the cold and semiarid Andean climate. Fertilizers with different NPK formulations enhance fresh aerial biomass, plant height and volume. Additionally, F. dolichophylla forms mycorrhizal associations, stores large amounts of fixed carbon in its stems, and bioaccumulates mercury, lead and arsenic. Despite its importance, Festuca dolichophylla remains poorly studied. Further research is needed to explore its ecology, breeding systems, diseases or ecotypes. Moreover, population and demographic studies are crucial to assess the impact of climate change on this species. Adaptive, strategic and organized management and conservation efforts are essential, particularly in Indigenous Andean settlements, where F. dolichophylla offers multiple applications and benefits. Furthermore, utilizing this species in grassland revegetation and restoration initiatives highlights the need for ongoing research and management endeavours to ensure its conservation and sustainable use. © 2024 The Author(s).

Linear regression models were performed to assess the relationship of cushion volume vs. dry biomass, and also the area vs. carbon content of cushions. We found highly significant (linear) relationships in both cases, indicating the potential use of SfM photogrammetry to evaluate the annual productivity, carbon and water storage of cushions, along with microtopography effects on plant–plant interactions, water flow routing, and disturbance effects in cushion-dominated peatlands. © 2023, IMCG and IPS.

Theoretical framework: Histosols are soils that provide ecosystem services, especially carbon stocks. Among the environments in which these soils are formed, peatlands stand out. The conversion of these areas into agricultural systems requires soil drainage. This practice causes reductions in carbon content and changes in the structure of the SOM. Methodology: The study was conducted in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The soils were classified as Histosols. Three areas were selected: a) cassava (Manihot esculenta) cultivation for 80 years; b) forest fragment for 20 years; c) consortium of coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) and cassava for 20 years. Total organic carbon (TOC); particulate organic carbon (COP); organic carbon associated with minerals (COam); fulvic acid fraction carbon (CAF); humic acid fraction carbon (CAH) and; humin fraction carbon (CHUM) were determined. Solid-state spectroscopy (UV-vis, ATR-FTIR and 13C NMR CP/MAS) was carried out to characterize the structure of the SOM. Results and conclusion: The results showed that management and drainage have an impact on the TOC content, fractions and chemical structure of the SOM. The management adopted in the cassava area had an impact on the labile and humified fractions of the SOM. Spectroscopy showed that labile structures were lost in the humic acids (HA), while in the forest area only recalcitrant structures were preserved. Research implications: The conversion of Histosols to agricultural production using the drainage technique promotes quantitative and qualitative changes in SOM in the long term. In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to use techniques that promote carbon stocks in the soil. Originality/value: This study uses spectroscopic and chemometric techniques to highlight the effects of long-term soil management on the chemical structure of the SOM and to quantify the total carbon content and SOM fractions. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

For the Argentine mineral soils, no significant differences in the 210Pbex inventories are found (ranging from 2920 ± 560 to 4570 ± 460 Bq/m2). The measured activity profiles are properly fitted by the one-dimensional transport model by effective diffusion and migration developed by He and Walling and the resulting parameters were analyzed considering the soil properties. It was observed that the migration rate is inversely proportional to the illite content, that the soils with higher amounts of smectite exhibit higher migration rates, and that the higher the pH, the higher the migration rate. These results agree with the higher Pb sorption capacity of smectite than illite, at identical conditions, and the Pb speciation with pH, that gives raise to different interactions between Pb and soil components. For organic soils, 210Pbex accumulates in superficial layers (5 cm depth) and the 210Pbex inventories (ranging from undetectable value to 5100 ± 200 Bq/m2) depend on the altitude of the sampling points. The activity values of 210Pbex and 137Cs (previously reported) are not significantly correlated, probably because the 137Cs fallout occurred more than 50 years ago, allowing the 137Cs profiles to develop. Finally, the deposit fluxes were determined for both regions studied and were incorporated into the global curve elaborated in previous works, contributing to a better definition of the general trend reported for the Southern Hemisphere. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","<sup>210</sup>Pb<sub>ex</sub>; Depositional fluxes; Inventories; Mineral soils; Organic soils; Profiles"

Although des-A-triterpenoids with lupane, oleanane, arborane, and ursane carbon skeleton structures were presumed to be indicative of terrestrial vascular angiosperms, recent studies have also identified other sources of des-A-triterpenoids in lakes and peatlands, such as algae and aerobic bacteria. Therefore, des-A-triterpenoids are valuable in paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental reconstructions from the perspectives of specific sources and microbial activities. des-Atriterpenoids could be more useful for source identification than n-alkanes and n-fatty acids, considering that nalkanes and n-fatty acids have multiple and complex sources. In recent decades, des-A-triterpenoids have been successfully applied in paleoenvironmental reconstructions of lakes from East Africa, South America, and Europe. In China, des-A-triterpenoids have been observed and identified in petroleum, coal, and recent peatland deposits, but no des-A-triterpenoids have been detected in modern lake environments. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the configuration structures, biosynthetic pathways, biological sources, and paleoenvironmental applications of des-A-triterpenoids in lake environments. This review describes a practical methodology for identifying des-A-triterpenoids. In addition, we reported the occurrence of des-A-triterpenoids with different configuration structures and distribution patterns in lakes Wuliangsu and Poyang. For instance, diunsaturated des-A-triterpenes with oleanane configurations were observed in eight of 21 surface sediments from Lake Wuliangsu. Alternatively, des-A-lupane and mono-unsaturated des-A-triterpenes with oleanane and ursane configurations were observed in samples from a sedimentary core collected from Lake Poyang at a depth of about 3 m. Our findings demonstrate that des-A-triterpenoids have great potential in and challenge paleoenvironmental and biogeochemical reconstructions of Chinese lakes. At the end of the review, we propose further directions and breakthroughs for this research area, such as improving analyzing protocols and technology, identification of the exact biological sources under a specific geological background of lakes, disentanglement of the mechanism of triterpenoid degradation, and application of environmental reconstruction in des-A-triterpenoid research. © 2021 Academic Press.

The main objective of the present work was to determine the spatial patterns of VTs related to climatic, topographic, and spectral variables across Santa Cruz province (Southern Patagonia, Argentina) in order to improve our understanding of land use cover at the regional scale. Also, we examined the spatial relationship between VTs and potential biodiversity (PB), ESs, and soil organic content (SOC) across our study region. We sampled 59,285 sites sorted into 19 major categories of land cover with a reliable discrimination level from field measurements. We selected 31 potential predictive environmental dataset covariates, which represent key factors for the spatial distribution of land cover such as climate (four), topography (three), and spectral (24) factors. All covariate maps were generated or uploaded to the Google Earth Engine cloud-based computing platform for subsequent modeling. A total of 270,292 sampling points were used for validation of the obtained classification map. The main land cover area estimates extracted from the map at the regional level identified about 142,085 km2 of grasslands (representing 58.1% of the total area), 38,355 km2 of Mata Negra Matorral thicket (15.7%), and about 25,189 km2 of bare soil (10.3%). From validation, the Overall Accuracy and the Kappa coefficient values for the classification map were 90.40% and 0.87, respectively. Pure and mixed forests presented the maximum SOC (11.3–11.8 kg m−2), followed by peatlands (10.6 kg m−2) and deciduous Nothofagus forests (10.5 kg m−2). The potential biodiversity was higher in some shrublands (64.1% in Mata Verde shrublands and 63.7% in mixed shrublands) and was comparable to those values found for open deciduous forests (Nothofagus antarctica forest with 60.4%). The provision of ESs presented maximum values at pure evergreen forests (56.7%) and minimum values at some shrubland types (Mata Negra Matorral thicket and mixed shrubland) and steppe grasslands (29.7–30.9%).

Floating or embalsados islands in warm water bodies have few studies and share some structural properties with temperate-cold weather peat bogs for which there is more information. In Argentina, the references are reduced to the middle and lower courses of the Paraná River, where the embalsados have a low frequency. The palynological analyzes carried out in the San Cristóbal, Cué and Miranda lakes aim to increase knowledge about the development of this biome in the Holocene of northeastern Iberá, central region of Corrientes Province. Three cores of the bottom of the lakes were obtained and the ages were estimated by applying the age-depth model calibrated with radiocarbon dates. The qualitative-quantitative analysis of 38 palynological associations allowed the distinction of two intervals. Between 4300 and 3600 years cal BP, the vegetation was dominated by herbaceous species of angiosperms and chlorophycean algae representatives of aquatic environments, marshes and reed beds and to a lesser extent by dammed-forming species. From 3500 years cal BP onwards, the frequency and variety of aquatic species of angiosperms and chlorophycean algae decreases and the predominance of grassland species and colonizers of water mirrors increases. This change suggests the development of embalsados with the formation of organic soils in the Late Holocene, probably as a result of a greater clogging of lakes and reduction of water mirror with oxygen deficit and water acidity. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Paleontologia.

Forest and land fires cause serious disturbance to these peatlands. Whereas more than two million hectares of peatlands burned during 2015, there was an overall decrease in the incidence of fires between 2016 and 2019. This raises the question of whether the decline was due to a change in the behaviour of human communities with regard to their use of fire. This study investigated self-perceived attitudes and behaviour changes amongst communities living in peatlands. Two villages in each of three districts (Pulang Pisau, Kapuas, OKI) within two provinces (Central Kalimantan, South Sumatra) were included. In-depth semi-structured interviews based on a questionnaire were conducted with 90 respondents (15 people per village). The results showed the perception that nearly all fires were caused by people using fire on small-to-medium pieces of land. Post-2015, social conditions were influenced by the creation of new regulations prohibiting burning, innovations in technology, and developing knowledge of the negative effects of fires on the economy. Thus, communities had been made more aware of the importance of preventing fires. This led to reduced interest in burning land and a willingness to start applying modern technology to the preparation of land for various uses. Most community members had actively participated in fire prevention activities. People felt that community landowners carry the greatest share of responsibility for managing their land. The dominant perception was that the ban on burning, socialised at village level, was one of the main reasons for the reduced incidence of fires. The existence of village fire control teams (MPAs), which provide fire-fighting equipment and knowledge, was perceived to strongly support changes in community attitudes to reducing fires. We emphasise that this study presents self-perceived changes in community attitudes and behaviour in using fire. © 2024, IMCG and IPS.

This research aimed to study chemical, morphological and crystallographic characteristics of kaolinite, and establish the origin of kaolinitic samples on Serra do Mar and kaolinitic layers on peatlands, located at Southern Brazil. Samples were collected on different geomorphological positions: two samples at Serra do Mar (kaolinitic saprolite – SAP, and kaolinitic layers-KL); and two cores at the peatland with Sapric Histosols from Quaternary sedimentary basin. Granulometry and total organic carbon (TOC) were determined in soil samples. Kaolinite in silt and clay fractions was studied by chemical extractions, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal analysis (DTA/TG), and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy – SEM/EDS. Chemical and mineralogical characteristics of kaolinite were divided into two groups, according to the particle size and the location of the deposit in the relief. Silt fraction: i) SAP – genesis mainly derived from mica weathering; ii) peatland, containing pseudomorph crystals smaller than those found in Serra do Mar; Clay fraction: i) Serra do Mar – there was a larger contribution of K-feldspar weathering in the genesis of kaolinite from KL in relation to SAP; ii) peatland – the stronger weathering and the hydromorphic conditions resulted in less neoformed crystalline kaolinites. For both environments, the substitution of Al3+ by Fe3+ into the octahedral sheet led to a reduction in the mineral thickness and also increased the occurrence of structural deformations in clay kaolinite. Kaolinite in peatland is a combination of the following genesis processes: transportation from Serra do Mar (mainly in the silt fraction) and; formation in situ through neogenesis process (dominant in the clay fraction). © 2024, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo.

These discussions have special resonance in places protected by the state for biodiversity, scenery, and sustainable and traditional land uses, such as those found in protected areas and biosphere reserves. For this article, we integrate data from a social-ecological research project on the land use systems that affect high-elevation ecosystems in Peru’s Huascarán National Park, with special emphasis on the wetlands. We used land cover and land use data and insights from interactions with pastoralists to show that (1) wet meadows dominate the lower reaches of the park, while peatlands predominate above 4000 m elevation; (2) wet meadows are most useful for traditional grazing systems, while the peatlands are especially susceptible to trampling by livestock; and (3) there is limited ecological space at the highest elevations for the successful future upward relocation of either land use or potential habitats for species identified as of concern. We explore the implications of these findings for the adaptive strategies of biophysical and social processes in terms of livelihoods and biodiversity in and around a protected area. We conclude that there are many additional opportunities to be explored to inform the management of ecosystem services and provide improvements for the adaptive capacity of communities and park managers. © 2023 by the authors.","biodiversity shifts; climate change; grazing systems; livestock; protected areas"
